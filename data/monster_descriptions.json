    "A-mi-kuk: Crimson slime covers this ungainly creature. Its tiny black eyes sit in an abnormally large head, and dozens of sharp teeth fill its small mouth. Its limbs end in large, grasping claws that look strong enough to crush the life out of a bear._  \n**Hidden Terror.** The dreaded a-mi-kuk is a terrifying creature that feasts on any who venture into the bleak and icy expanses of the world. A-mi-kuks prowl the edges of isolated communities, snatching those careless enough to wander too far from camp. They also submerge themselves beneath frozen waters, coming up from below to grab and strangle lone fishermen.  \n**Fear of Flames.** A-mi-kuks have a deathly fear of fire, and anyone using fire against one has a good chance of making it flee in terror, even if the fire-user would otherwise be outmatched. A-mi-kuks are not completely at the mercy of this fear, however, and lash out with incredible fury if cornered by someone using fire against them.  \n**Unknown Origins.** A-mi-kuks are not natural creatures and contribute little to the ecosystems in which they live. The monsters are never seen together, and some believe them to be a single monster, an evil spirit made flesh that appears whenever a group of humans has angered the gods. A-mi-kuks have no known allies and viciously attack any creatures that threaten them, regardless of the foe\u2019s size or power.",
    "Aalpamac: A chimeric beast with the body of a massive trout and the front claws and head of a fierce wolverine bursts up from the icy water. Its eyes glow with a lambent green light, and the air around it bends and distorts as if viewed through a thick lens._  \n**Hungry Lake Monsters.** The aalpamac is a dangerous freshwater predator native to lakes and rivers. While primarily a water-dwelling monster, the aalpamac can haul itself onto shore with its front claws and does so to attack prey drinking or moving at the water\u2019s edge. While not evil, the aalpamac is a ravenous and territorial creature, ranging over an area of up to a dozen miles in search of fresh meat. Aalpamacs are not picky about what they consume and even attack large boats if sufficiently hungry. They are solitary creatures and tolerate others of their own kind only during mating seasons.  \n**Local Legends.** An aalpamac that terrorizes the same lake or river for many years often develops a reputation among the locals of the area, particularly those living along the body of water in question. Inevitably, this gives rise to a number of stories exaggerating the size, ferocity, disposition, or powers of the aalpamac. The stories often give aalpamacs names that highlight their most prominent features or are specific to the area in which they live, such as \u201cChompo\u201d or \u201cthe Heron Lake Monster.\u201d These stories also make the aalpamac the target of adventurers and trophy hunters, most of whom either do not locate the beast or fall victim to it.",
    "Abbanith Giant: This giant has a bulky, muscular body and small eyes in its broad, flat face. The giant\u2019s thumbs end in large, black claws._  \n**Ancient Giants of the Deep.** Abbanith giants are among the oldest races of giants known to exist and are said to have been around since the world was first formed. Many scholars turn to the giants\u2019 deep connection with the earth as evidence of this fact, and the giants themselves make no efforts to deny it. Indeed, the oral tradition of the abbanith giants dates back millennia, to a time when gods walked the land, elves were first learning the secrets of magic, and humans were still living in caves. Most abbanith giants wear simple tunics or shorts woven of a strange subterranean fungus, though leaders occasionally wear armor.  \n**Consummate Diggers.** Abbanith giants dwell almost exclusively underground and are adept at using their incredibly hard thumb claws to dig massive tunnels through the earth. Druids and wizards studying the giants\u2019 unique biology have deduced that mineral-based materials actually soften when struck by their claws. This feature has also made them the target of derro and duergar slavers wishing to use their skills to mine precious gems or build their fortifications, something the giants violently oppose despite their normally peaceable nature.  \n**Allies of the Earth.** For as long as either race can remember, abbanith giants have been allies of the Open Game License",
    "Abominable Beauty: _An otherworldly humanoid of such indescribable beauty, it pains anyone\u2019s eyes to gaze upon her._  \n**Beauty that Destroys.** An abominable beauty is so perfect that her gaze blinds, her voice is so melodious that no ears can withstand it, and her touch is so tantalizing that it burns like fire. In adolescence, this fey creature adopts features that meet the superficial ideals of the nearest humanoid population: long\u2010legged elegance near elves, a stout figure with lustrous hair near dwarves, unscarred or emerald skin near goblins.  \n**Jealous and Cruel.** Abominable beauties are so consumed with being the most beautiful creature in the region that they almost invariably grow jealous and paranoid about potential rivals. Because such an abominable beauty cannot abide competition, she seeks to kill anyone whose beauty is compared to her own.  \n**Male of the Species.** Male abominable beauties are rare but even more jealous in their rages.",
    "Accursed Defiler: _A gaunt figure in a tattered black mantle shrouded in a cloud of whirling sand. Thin cracks run across its papyrus-dry skin and around its hollow, black eyes._  \n**Cursed to Wander and Thirst.** Accursed defilers are the remnants of an ancient tribe that desecrated a sacred oasis. For their crime, the wrathful spirits cursed the tribe to forever wander the wastes attempting to quench an insatiable thirst. Each defiler carries a parched sandstorm within its lungs and in the flowing sand in its veins. Wherever they roam, they leave only the desiccated husks of their victims littering the sand.  \n**Unceasing Hatred.** The desperate or foolish sometimes try to speak with these ill-fated creatures in their archaic native tongue, to learn their secrets or to bargain for their services, but a defiler\u2019s heart is blackened with hate and despair, leaving room for naught but woe.  \n**Servants to Great Evil.** On very rare occasions, accursed defilers serve evil high priests, fext, or soulsworn warlocks as bodyguards and zealous destroyers, eager to spread the withering desert\u2019s hand to new lands.  \n**Undead Nature.** An accursed defiler doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Acolyte: **Acolytes** are junior members of a clergy, usually answerable to a priest. They perform a variety of functions in a temple and are granted minor spellcasting power by their deities.",
    "Adult Boreal Dragon: Covered in a mix of hard, blue-white scales and patches of silvery-blue fur, this dragon radiates a savage belligerence. Its amber eyes gleam with primal fury as it stretches its wings, sending a shower of burning sparks sizzling onto the ground._  \n**Paradoxical Predators.** Boreal dragons inhabit the arctic and alpine places of the world, from snow-capped conifer forests and frigid mountain peaks to flat, icy plains and polar seas. Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.  \n**Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon\u2019s admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter. In particular, the dragons are fond of large arctic predators, such as Open Game License",
    "Adult Cave Dragon: Covered in black spikes, the dragon\u2019s eyeless head swings from side to side. Darkness creeps from its strange, eel-like hide, spreading like ink in water.  \nApex predators of the underworld, cave dragons are the stuff of nightmare for creatures with little else to fear. They can speak, but they value silence, speaking rarely except when bargaining for food.  \n_**Born to Darkness.**_ Eyeless, these dragons have long, thin spikes that help them navigate tunnels, or seal passages around them, preventing foes from outflanking them. Their stunted wings are little more than feelers, useful in rushing down tunnels. Their narrow snouts poke into tight passages which their tongues scour free of bats and vermin. Young cave dragons and wyrmlings can fly, poorly, but older specimens lose the gift of flight entirely.  \nCave dragon coloration darkens with age, but it always provides good camouflage against stone: white like limestone, yellow, muddy brown, then black at adult and older categories. Mature adult and old cave dragons sometimes fade to gray again.  \n_**Ravenous Marauders.**_ Cave dragons are always hungry and ready to eat absolutely everything. They devour undead, plant creatures, or anything organic. When feeding, they treat all nearby creatures as both a threat and the next course. What alliances they do make only last so long as their allies make themselves scarce when the dragon feeds. They can be bribed with food as easily as with gold, but other attempts at diplomacy typically end in failure. Cave dragons do form alliances with derro or drow, joining them in battle against the darakhul, but there is always a price to be paid in flesh, bone, and marrow. Wise allies keep a cave dragon well fed.  \n_**A Hard Life.**_ Limited food underground makes truly ancient cave dragons almost unheard of. The eldest die of starvation after stripping their territory bare of prey. A few climb to the surface to feed, but their sensitivity to sunlight, earthbound movement, and lack of sight leave them at a terrible disadvantage.  \n\n## A Cave Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nLabyrinthine systems of tunnels, caverns, and chasms make up the world of cave dragons. They claim miles of cave networks as their own. Depending on the depth of their domain, some consider the surface world their territory as well, though they visit only to eliminate potential rivals.  \nLarge vertical chimneys, just big enough to contain the beasts, make preferred ambush sites for young cave dragons. Their ruff spikes hold them in position until prey passes beneath.  \nDue to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon\u2019s hoard may consist largely of food sources: colonies of bats, enormous beetles, carcasses in various states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn\u2019t immediately devour.  \nCave dragons are especially fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, sorted or arranged like artful ossuaries.  \nCave dragons have no permanent society. They gather occasionally to mate and to protect their eggs at certain spawning grounds. Large vertical chimneys are popular nesting sites. There, the oldest cave dragons also retreat to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action for one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.\n* A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom.\n* The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon. Creatures that are in the affected space or that enter it take 22 (4d10) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The swarm lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary cave dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Poisonous and odorless gases suddenly fill passages and caverns, and just as quickly disperse, within six miles of the dragon\u2019s lair.\n* Flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within six miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.\n* Swarms of vermin within one mile of the lair increase in both size and number as they try to escape the dragon\u2019s endless and undiscriminating hunger.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.",
    "Adult Flame Dragon: _The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw._  \nThe flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. \u201cMay you be the fire\u2019s plaything\u201d is a curse often used by the foolish.  \n_**Taunting Others.**_ The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure\u2014direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler\u2019s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.  \n_**Malevolent Purpose.**_ The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon\u2019s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.  \n_**Fond of Souvenirs.**_ Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.  \nNothing is safe from a flame dragon\u2019s endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon\u2019s undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon\u2019s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.  \n\n## Flame Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nFlame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest instincts in their prey.  \nMany of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n* The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can\u2019t stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check.\n* A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary flame dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.\n* Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines.\n* Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon\u2019s lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they\u2019re spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days. Any geysers remain where they are.",
    "Adult Imperial Dragon: The long, serpentine dragon is wingless and possesses shimmering, opalescent scales. Its appearance is at once both serene and majestic._  \n**Dragons of the Spirit World.** Imperial dragons are tied to the world of celestials, fiends, and spirits. They freely parley with such creatures for knowledge about the outer planes or the fundamental mysteries of the universe. Some of the most powerful imperial dragons even become the servants of the gods in exchange for wisdom, acting as intermediaries between the divine and mortal realms.  \n**Colorful and Magical.** Imperial dragons are capable of changing their colors and forms. They are typically a rich, golden-yellow, but azure-, jade-, and vermillion-colored dragons are not unheard of, and even white and black imperial dragons have been reported. A magical organ in their skulls gives them the ability to fly without the aid of wings, and they are often hunted for this organ, which is rumored to grant eternal life if consumed.  \n**Masters of Wind and Rain.** Imperial dragons are creatures of wind and water, and the eldest of their kind exhibit mastery of these elements. They love the seas where they make their homes and sometimes act as guardians for sacred sites or temples near or beneath the waves. This often puts them in conflict with militant aquatic races like the Open Game License",
    "Adult Mithral Dragon: _Mithral dragons are wise and learned, and are legendary peacemakers and spellcasters. They pursue their own interests when not called to settle disputes._  \n_**Glimmering Champions.**_ Light glints off a mithral dragon\u2019s glossy scales, shining silver-white, and its tiny wings fold flush against its body\u2014but open like a fan to expose shimmering, diaphanous membranes. Its narrow head, with bare slits for its eyes and nostrils, ends in a slender neck. The dragon\u2019s sleek look continues into its body and a mithral dragon\u2019s impossibly thin frame makes it look extremely fragile.  \n_**Rage in Youth.**_ Younger mithral dragons raid and pillage as heavily as any chromatic dragon, driven largely by greed to acquire a worthy hoard\u2014though they are less likely to kill for sport or out of cruelty. In adulthood and old age, however, they are less concerned with material wealth and more inclined to value friendship, knowledge, and a peaceful life spent in pursuit of interesting goals.  \n_**Peacemakers.**_ Adult and older mithral dragons are diplomats and arbitrators by temperament (some dragons cynically call them referees), enjoying bringing some peace to warring factions. Among all dragons, their strict neutrality and ability to ignore many attacks make them particularly well suited to these vital roles.",
    "Adult Rime Worm: _These long, crusty slugs sparkle like ice. A gaping hole at one end serves as a mouth, from which long tendrils emanate._  \nRime worms are sometimes kept as guards by frost giants.  \n_**Ice Burrowers.**_ The rime worm\u2019s tendrils help it to burrow through ice and snow as well absorb sustenance from prey. Their pale, almost translucent, skin is coated with ice crystals, making them difficult to spot in their snowy habitat.  \n_**Spray Black Ice.**_ The worms are fierce hunters, and their ability to spray skewers of ice and rotting flesh makes them extremely dangerous.",
    "Adult Sea Dragon: _This aquamarine dragon has a shark\u2019s head that tapers off into a sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings._  \n**Divine Dragons.** Sea dragons are the children of the ocean, and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.  \nDespite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.  \n**Shipwreck Art.** Sea dragons love collecting treasure, especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon\u2019s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.  \n**Sunken Memorials.** A sea dragon\u2019s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.  \n\n## Sea Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nSea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.  \nWhatever the place, it\u2019s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.  \nThe sky surrounding a sea dragon\u2019s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall\u2019s space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary sea dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.\n* Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water.\n* Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, conditions of the sea surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.",
    "Adult Void Dragon: _A dragon seemingly formed of the night sky has bright white stars for eyes. Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon\u2019s body._  \n**Children of the Stars.** Void dragons drift through the empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world, wanderers between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons themselves barely notice.  \n**Witnesses to the Void.** Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing outside has taken a toll. The void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.  \n**Voracious Scholars.** Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.  \n\n## A Void Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nThe true lair of a void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless void between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the void dragon\u2019s lair rests in the great void of space.  \nWhen a void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to reach its treasure hoard hidden in the void. That connection has repercussions, of course, and the most powerful void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.  \nIf fought in its lair, its Challenge increases by 1, to 15 for an adult (13,000 XP) and 25 for an ancient void dragon (75,000 XP).  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n* The Void briefly overlaps the dragon\u2019s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary void dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.\n* Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can\u2019t create bright light in this area.\n* Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon\u2019s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.",
    "Adult Wind Dragon: _Howling wind encircles the white- and gray-scaled dragon, filling and pushing its wings without the need for them to beat._  \nWind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property, and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.  \n_**Braggarts and Bullies.**_ Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it\u2019s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.  \n_**Lords of the Far Horizons.**_ Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.  \n_**Perpetual Infighting.**_ These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.  \nWind dragons\u2019 hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons quickly. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a smaller number of notable trophies or unique historic items\u2014often quite portable.  \n\n## Wind Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nWind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can\u2019t pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.\n* Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair\u2019s wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n* A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of their next turn.",

    "Akaasit: A cloud of unconnected, flat gray triangles in the vague shape of a mantis flickers unpredictably from one position to another, clicking softly as its arm blades swing outward. Akaasits are constructed beings from a plane destroyed by a catastrophic misuse of time magic. They were altered by this catastrophe and now exist in the present and in fractions of a second in the past and future._  \n**Mindless.** The akaasit has no mind, at least as understood by denizens of the Material Plane, and its motives are inscrutable. Each akaasit is always found moving toward some unknown destination. It may attack other creatures, or it may ignore them. It protects itself if attacked, but rarely does an akaasit pursue a retreating foe.  \n**Unknown Origin.** The home of the akaasit is unknown, but they are often encountered in areas touched or altered by time magic. Although a few wizards have discovered magical methods of summoning them, none have found a way to control or communicate with them. Akaasits seem to be drawn to spellcasters with some mastery of time magic, though it is always a gamble if an individual akaasit will protect or ruthlessly attack such a spellcaster. An akaasit\u2019s demeanor can change each day, and many time magic spellcasters have been found slain by the same akaasit that faithfully protected them the day prior.  \n**Dispersed Destruction.** If an akaasit is destroyed, it falls apart into a pile of gray triangles. These triangles fade out of existence over the next ten minutes, leaving only the akaasit\u2019s two armblades.  \n**Construct Nature.** The akaasit doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Akhlut: Possessing the body, head, and tail of a killer whale and the powerful legs of a huge wolf, the akhlut is the alpha predator of the polar landscape. Truly personifying the term \u201cseawolf,\u201d these intelligent and resilient creatures travel freely between the land and sea in search of prey._  \nAkhluts are the masters of their domain. Though they have been seen across all of the world\u2019s oceans and many of its coastlines, akhluts are most comfortable in cold regions with easy access to the sea. Because their pods can reach almost a dozen members, anything is fair game from reindeer and seals to mammoths and whales. The only beings powerful enough, or foolhardy enough, to evict a pod of akhluts from their territory are dragons and other akhluts.  \n**Playful Predators.** Akhluts possess undeniable cunning and inquisitiveness, with no two pods using the same strategies to solve problems or hunt prey. Easily bored, akhluts crave stimulation and are known to follow ships and caravans for miles in the hopes that someone might provide something new or exciting to experience. They can be especially mischievous, freeing fish and game from traps purely to hunt he creatures themselves.  \n**Dangerous Steeds.** The akhlut\u2019s natural power, intelligence, and versatility make them incredibly desirable mounts, but the effort to tame one of these creatures is dangerous and not to be taken lightly. Even akhluts who have been mounts for years are willful enough to assert themselves from time to time. With a great deal of patience and a little luck, akhluts can become fiercely loyal and protective companions.",
    "Al-Aeshma Genie: _A savage parody of a djinni, an al-Aeshma\u2019s lower half is composed of scorching winds and desert sand._  \n**Sand Djinnis.** The al-Aeshma are former djinn and share the same powers, albeit in a darker style. Their skin is black as pitch, and their whirlwind form includes much dust and sand. Only radiant or fire damage can slay them entirely\u2014otherwise the desert sand flows to seal their wounds and reattach severed limbs.  \n**Obligation of Wishes.** Granting three wishes to a mortal is a sacred and serious obligation among the genies, referred to as being wishbound. The Lords of Air mandate this as celestial law, and many believe that a djinni cannot refuse to grant a wish. Certainly the consequences of disobedience are dire.  \nThose djinn who decline to grant a wish, for any reason, are stripped of their wish power and handed to efreeti for 1,001 years of torture and debasement. Those that survive are banished to wander the Material Plane.  \n**Unforgiven.** No al-Aeshma has ever been forgiven. Their punishment drives them mad, and makes them anything but contrite. Al-Aeshma are a feral, mocking scourge to all other genies, even efreeti, for they know many secrets and their hearts lust for revenge.",
    "Ala: _Alas are born from galls that grow on treant trunks. Within this parasitic pocket, an ala sickens the treant and consumes its life force. When the treant dies, the ala is born in a black whirlwind._  \n**Daughters of the Whirlwind.** Alas have windblown hair and wear smoky black rags, but their true form is that of a whirlwind, which can always be seen by \u0161estaci, those men and women with six digits on each hand. In flight or in battle, an ala takes on a form with the upper body of a hag and a whirling vortex of air in place of hips and legs. When an ala enters a house in human form, the whole building groans in protest, as if it had been struck by a powerful stormwind.  \nAlas live in the hollows of trees that were struck by lightning. They are most active when thunder rocks the forest, and when they travel hail or thunderstorms spawn around them.  \n**Enormous Appetites.**The huge-mouthed alas have voracious appetites. In the wild, they devour wolves, bears, and badgers. They prefer to hunt in settled areas, however, because they favor the taste of innocents above all else. Unsavory tribes of savage humanoids may beg an ala\u2019s favor (or divert its wrath) with gifts of bound captives.  \n**Energized by Storms.** In battle, an ala is constantly on the move, weaving between foes like the wind. It tears at its foes with claws and a poisonous bite, or throws wicked lightning bolts and hailstorms from afar. Woe betides the hero who confronts an ala while a storm rages overhead, because such storms energize the ala and make its lightning stronger. Because alas wield lightning with such mastery, some sages associate them with the god of lightning.",
    "Alchemical Skunk: The large skunk waddles forward, sniffing at a spilled potion. As a sound nearby startles it, the skunk raises its tail, and the stripes on its back change color._  \n**Magical Prank.** The unfortunate result of a magic school prank, alchemical skunks were created when an ordinary skunk was forced to drink a combination of potions. Despite their larger size, alchemical skunks still look and act like ordinary skunks, except for the ever-changing color of the stripes on their backs. Experienced foresters know that the colors on the alchemical skunk\u2019s back indicate which magical malady the creature is about to spray and do their best to avoid aggravating these dangerous creatures.  \n**Laboratory Pests.** Alchemical skunks forage the same as their nonmagical kin, but they are also regularly found scavenging the waste of alchemical laboratories. They enjoy feasting on potions and potion components, much to the dismay of alchemists and adventurers alike.",
    "Alehouse Drake: _This plump little creature reclines with a dazed look in its eyes and the suggestion of a grin on its fanged jaws._  \n**Scaled Barflies.** Alehouse drakes squat in busy bars, rowdy taverns, and bustling inns. A bane or savior to every bartender and innkeeper, alehouse drakes enjoy pushing patrons\u2019 emotions, driving crowds to ecstatic cheers or bloody bar fights.  \nAlehouse drakes make their homes in cities and towns, though older drakes settle down in roadside coaching inns. In the former situations, they are often troublemakers or pranksters, but in the latter circumstances, they usually befriend the proprietor and help manage flared tempers and weepy drinkers in return for living space and a generous tab.  \n**Relentless Gossips.** Alehouse drakes gossip endlessly. Perched in hiding places throughout busy taverns, they overhear many stories, and often trade in information, making them good sources for news about town. More devious and ill-mannered alehouse drakes resort to blackmail, but usually only to secure a comfortable spot in their chosen tavern.  \n**Family Heirlooms.** Alehouse drakes are one to two feet long on average and weigh about eighteen lb. with a plump belly. Their scales are deep amber with cream or white highlights, and they possess glittering, light-colored eyes. The oldest recorded alehouse drake lived just past 400 years\u2014some are quite beloved by innkeeping families, and treated bit like family heirlooms.",
    "Algorith: _Sometimes called folding angels, algoriths are lawful beings made from sheer force, pure math, and universal physical laws._  \n**Creatures of Pure Reason.**They are the border guards of the Conceptual Realms, warding subjective beings from the Realms of the Absolute. Eternal, remorseless, and unceasingly vigilant, they guard against the monstrosities that lurk in the multiverse\u2019s most obscure dimensions, and seek out and eliminate chaos even from the abodes of the gods.  \n**Foes of Chaos.**They visit mortal realms when chaos threatens to unravel a location, or when the skeins of fate are tangled. On some occasions, an algorith will serve a god of Law or answer the summons of a skein witch.  \nAlgoriths fight with conjured blades of force, and they can also summon universal energy that deconstructs randomness, weakening enemies or reducing them to finely ordered crystalline dust.  \n**Social but Mysterious.** In groups, they move and fight in silent coordination. Only tiny variations in the formulas etched into their skins identify one algorith from another. Five is a number of extreme importance to all algoriths, but few are willing (or able) to explain why to anyone who isn\u2019t an algorith. Algoriths may have castes, ranks, or commanders, but no mortal has decoded the mathematical blazons adorning their flesh.The algoriths themselves refuse to discuss these formulas with those who do not comprehend them.  \n**Constructed Nature.** An algorith doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

    "Alpha Fish: A fish as large as a rowboat serenely floats beneath the surface of the water, its flowing fins and iridescent scales shimmering in the waves. When disturbed, it attacks with a ferocity unexpected of such a delicate-looking creature._  \nAlpha fish are solitary and extremely territorial creatures. They are always found alone, except during the few short weeks of mating season each year when schools of the fish gather.  \n**Dazzling Dominance.** Before attacking, alpha fish often attempt to intimidate potential rivals or predators away by flaring their colorful fins to make themselves appear much larger. If successful, they usually refrain from attacking.  \n**Aggressive.** If intimidation doesn\u2019t work, alpha fish defend their chosen homes by viciously attacking. They have been known to attack creatures much larger than themselves and, occasionally, objects they don\u2019t recognize.  \n**Valuable.** Many aristocrats seek the beautiful, shimmering fish as pets in massive, personal aquariums, and the alpha fish\u2019s scales are valuable spell components.",
    "Alseid: _Alseids are the graceful woodland cousins to centaurs, with the slender upper body of an elf and the lower body of a deer. Because they are rarely seen far from the wooded glades they call home, they are sometimes called \u201cgrove nymphs,\u201d despite being more closely related to elves than nymphs._  \n**Forest Guardians.** Alseids see the forest as an individual and a friend.They are suspicious of outsiders who do not share this view. Lost travelers who demonstrate deep respect for the forest may spot a distant alseid\u2019s white tail; if they chase after it as it bounds away, the sympathetic alseid may lead it toward a road or trail that can carry them out of the forest. Disrespectful strangers may follow the same tail to their doom. Alseids have no compunction about slaughtering trespassers who burn or cut down their forest.  \n**Antlers Show Status.** Alseids have antlers growing from their foreheads.These antlers grow very slowly, branching every 10 years for the first century of life. Further points only develop with the blessing of the forest. No fourteen-point imperial alseids are known to exist, but many tribes are governed by princes with thirteen points. Because antlers signify status, alseids never use them in combat. Cutting an alseid\u2019s antlers entirely off or just removing points is a humiliating and grave punishment.  \n**White-Tailed Wanderers.** Alseids have a deep connection with forest magic of all kinds, and their leaders favor the druid and ranger classes.",

    "Amphiptere: _The amphiptere is most commonly found as a flight of gold-crested, bat-winged serpents bursting from the foliage._  \n**Tiny Wyverns.** An amphiptere has batlike wings and a stinger similar to a wyvern\u2019s at the end of its tail. Their reptilian bodies are scaly, but their wings sprout greenish-yellow feathers.  \n**Swooping and Swift.** They are surprisingly maneuverable in spite of their size, able to change direction suddenly and make deadly hit-and-run strikes. They swoop in and out of combat, snapping at targets with their needlelike teeth and striking with their envenomed stingers. Once a foe is poisoned and injured, they hover closer in a tightly packed, flapping mass of fangs, battering wings, and jabbing stingers.  \n**Strength in Flocks.** Despite their fighting ability, amphipteres are not particularly brave. Most often, they tend to lurk in small flocks in dense foliage, where they can burst forth in a flurry of wings when prey comes within view. They display surprising cunning and tenacity in large groups; they may harass foes for minutes or hours before closing in for the kill.",
    "Ancient Boreal Dragon: Covered in a mix of hard, blue-white scales and patches of silvery-blue fur, this dragon radiates a savage belligerence. Its amber eyes gleam with primal fury as it stretches its wings, sending a shower of burning sparks sizzling onto the ground._  \n**Paradoxical Predators.** Boreal dragons inhabit the arctic and alpine places of the world, from snow-capped conifer forests and frigid mountain peaks to flat, icy plains and polar seas. Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.  \n**Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon\u2019s admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter. In particular, the dragons are fond of large arctic predators, such as Open Game License",
    "Ancient Flame Dragon: _The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw._  \nThe flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. \u201cMay you be the fire\u2019s plaything\u201d is a curse often used by the foolish.  \n_**Taunting Others.**_ The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure\u2014direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler\u2019s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.  \n_**Malevolent Purpose.**_ The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon\u2019s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.  \n_**Fond of Souvenirs.**_ Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.  \nNothing is safe from a flame dragon\u2019s endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon\u2019s undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon\u2019s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.  \n\n## Flame Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nFlame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest instincts in their prey.  \nMany of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n* The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can\u2019t stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check.\n* A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary flame dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.\n* Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines.\n* Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon\u2019s lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they\u2019re spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days. Any geysers remain where they are.",
    "Ancient Imperial Dragon: The long, serpentine dragon is wingless and possesses shimmering, opalescent scales. Its appearance is at once both serene and majestic._  \n**Dragons of the Spirit World.** Imperial dragons are tied to the world of celestials, fiends, and spirits. They freely parley with such creatures for knowledge about the outer planes or the fundamental mysteries of the universe. Some of the most powerful imperial dragons even become the servants of the gods in exchange for wisdom, acting as intermediaries between the divine and mortal realms.  \n**Colorful and Magical.** Imperial dragons are capable of changing their colors and forms. They are typically a rich, golden-yellow, but azure-, jade-, and vermillion-colored dragons are not unheard of, and even white and black imperial dragons have been reported. A magical organ in their skulls gives them the ability to fly without the aid of wings, and they are often hunted for this organ, which is rumored to grant eternal life if consumed.  \n**Masters of Wind and Rain.** Imperial dragons are creatures of wind and water, and the eldest of their kind exhibit mastery of these elements. They love the seas where they make their homes and sometimes act as guardians for sacred sites or temples near or beneath the waves. This often puts them in conflict with militant aquatic races like the Open Game License",
    "Ancient Mithral Dragon: _Mithral dragons are wise and learned, and are legendary peacemakers and spellcasters. They pursue their own interests when not called to settle disputes._  \n_**Glimmering Champions.**_ Light glints off a mithral dragon\u2019s glossy scales, shining silver-white, and its tiny wings fold flush against its body\u2014but open like a fan to expose shimmering, diaphanous membranes. Its narrow head, with bare slits for its eyes and nostrils, ends in a slender neck. The dragon\u2019s sleek look continues into its body and a mithral dragon\u2019s impossibly thin frame makes it look extremely fragile.  \n_**Rage in Youth.**_ Younger mithral dragons raid and pillage as heavily as any chromatic dragon, driven largely by greed to acquire a worthy hoard\u2014though they are less likely to kill for sport or out of cruelty. In adulthood and old age, however, they are less concerned with material wealth and more inclined to value friendship, knowledge, and a peaceful life spent in pursuit of interesting goals.  \n_**Peacemakers.**_ Adult and older mithral dragons are diplomats and arbitrators by temperament (some dragons cynically call them referees), enjoying bringing some peace to warring factions. Among all dragons, their strict neutrality and ability to ignore many attacks make them particularly well suited to these vital roles.",
    "Ancient Sea Dragon: _This aquamarine dragon has a shark\u2019s head that tapers off into a sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings._  \n**Divine Dragons.** Sea dragons are the children of the ocean, and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.  \nDespite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.  \n**Shipwreck Art.** Sea dragons love collecting treasure, especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon\u2019s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.  \n**Sunken Memorials.** A sea dragon\u2019s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.  \n\n## Sea Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nSea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.  \nWhatever the place, it\u2019s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.  \nThe sky surrounding a sea dragon\u2019s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall\u2019s space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary sea dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.\n* Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water.\n* Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, conditions of the sea surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.",
    "Ancient Titan: _Radiating a powerful presence, this towering humanoid has sharp-edged features that seem hewn from ancient stone._  \n**Children of the Gods.** Ancient titans are the surviving immortal children of an early primordial god. They fled to the wilds after a divine war, where they founded an empire that lasted thousands of years before plague brought about its collapse.  \n**Sea God\u2019s Servants.** A few ancient titans still dwell in the ocean realm, spared by the sea god in exchange for eternal servitude. Ancient titans have long, glossy hair, usually black, red, or silver, and they stand 60 feet tall and weigh over 20 tons.  \n**Friends to Dragons.** Ancient titans have a strong rapport with wind and sea dragons, as well as gold, silver, and mithral dragons.",
    "Ancient Void Dragon: _A dragon seemingly formed of the night sky has bright white stars for eyes. Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon\u2019s body._  \n**Children of the Stars.** Void dragons drift through the empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world, wanderers between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons themselves barely notice.  \n**Witnesses to the Void.** Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing outside has taken a toll. The void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.  \n**Voracious Scholars.** Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.  \n\n## A Void Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nThe true lair of a void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless void between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the void dragon\u2019s lair rests in the great void of space.  \nWhen a void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to reach its treasure hoard hidden in the void. That connection has repercussions, of course, and the most powerful void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.  \nIf fought in its lair, its Challenge increases by 1, to 15 for an adult (13,000 XP) and 25 for an ancient void dragon (75,000 XP).  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n* The Void briefly overlaps the dragon\u2019s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary void dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.\n* Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can\u2019t create bright light in this area.\n* Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon\u2019s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.",
    "Ancient Wind Dragon: _Howling wind encircles the white- and gray-scaled dragon, filling and pushing its wings without the need for them to beat._  \nWind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property, and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.  \n_**Braggarts and Bullies.**_ Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it\u2019s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.  \n_**Lords of the Far Horizons.**_ Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.  \n_**Perpetual Infighting.**_ These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.  \nWind dragons\u2019 hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons quickly. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a smaller number of notable trophies or unique historic items\u2014often quite portable.  \n\n## Wind Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nWind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can\u2019t pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.\n* Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair\u2019s wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n* A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of their next turn.",
    "Andrenjinyi: _A gigantic, black-headed snake is over 60 feet long and sheathed in brilliant scales, each andrenjinyi is splashed with vibrant patterns of every imaginable color. The air around these serpents is heavy, redolent of the quenched red desert after a torrential thunderstorm._  \nAndrenjinyi are the descendants of the Rainbow Serpent, the first and greatest spirit of the world\u2019s beginning.The Rainbow Serpent\u2019s children are dichotomous nature spirits of land and sky, sun and rain, male and female, and birth and destruction.  \n**Last of their Kind.** The Rainbow Serpent shed andrenjinyi like cast-off scales during her primordial wanderings, but she has created no more since she ascended to the stars. While andrenjinyi are ageless fertility spirits, they cannot themselves reproduce; each one is an irreplaceable link to primeval creation.  \n**Hunt and Transform.** Andrenjinyi are naturally aquatic, preferring to live in deep, fresh, life- giving rivers and lakes.The serpents usually attack intruders unless they approach with the correct rites or offerings, which require a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Religion) check.  \nAndrenjinyi hunt as other animals do, but they transform devoured prey into unique species with their Transmuting Gullet ability, creating mixed gender pairs. An andrenjinyi\u2019s sacred pool and surroundings often shelters a menagerie of strange and beautiful animals.  \n**Demand Obedience and Ritual.** When offered rituals and obedience, andrenjinyi sometimes protect nearby communities with drought-breaking rains, cures for afflictions, or the destruction of rivals. Revered andrenjinyi take offense when their petitioners break fertility and familial edicts, such as prohibitions on incest, rape, and matricide, but also obscure obligations including soothing crying infants and the ritual sacrifice of menstrual blood. Punishments are malevolently disproportionate, often inflicted on the whole community and including baking drought, flooding rains, petrification, pestilence, and animalistic violence.Thus, tying a community\u2019s well-being to an andrenjinyi is a double-edged sword.",
    "Angatra: _This withered creature wrapped in gore-stained rags. They can pull back a tattered hood to reveal glowing eyes hungry with bloodlust._  \nIn certain tribes, the breaking of local taboos invites terrible retribution from ancestral spirits, especially if the transgressor was a tribal leader or elder. The transgressor is cursed and cast out from the tribe, and then hunted and executed.  \n**Bound Remains Entombed.** The body is wrapped head to toe in lamba cloth to soothe the spirit and to bind it within the mortal husk, then sealed in a tomb far from traditional burial grounds so none may disturb it and its unclean spirit does not taint the blessed dead.  \n**Slow Ritual Cleansing.** Each such body is visited every ten years as the tribe performs the famadihana ritual, replacing the lamba bindings and soothing the suffering of the ancestors. Over generations, this ritual expiates their guilt, until at last the once\u2011accursed ancestor is admitted through the gates of the afterlife. If a spirit\u2019s descendants abandon their task, or if the sealed tomb is violated, the accursed soul becomes an angatra.  \n**Angry Spirit.** The creature\u2019s form becomes animated by a powerful and malicious ancestor spirit and undergoes a horrible metamorphosis within its decaying cocoon. Its fingernails grow into scabrous claws, its skin becomes hard and leathery, and its withered form is imbued with unnatural speed and agility. Within days, the angatra gathers strength and tears its bindings into rags. It seeks out its descendants to to share the torment and wrath it endured while its spirit lingered.",
    "Angel, Chained: _Their wings are still feathered, but their soulless eyes betray a great rage and thirst for blood. They invariably wear chains, shackles, barbed flesh hooks, or manacles to show their captive state. Some have heavy chain leashes held by arch-devils or major demons. All chained angels have halos of pure black, and many have been flayed of their skin along one or more limbs._  \n**Broken and Chained.** These angels have been captured by fiends, tortured, and turned to serve darkness. A pack of chained angels is considered a status symbol among the servants of evil. A chained angel fights for the forces of evil as long as they remain chained, and this amuses demons and devils greatly.  \n**Chance at Redemption.** However, while their souls are tainted with the blood of innocents, in their hearts chained angels still hope to be redeemed, or at least to be given the solace of extinction. Any creature that kills a chained angel is given a gift of gratitude for the release of death, in the form of all the effects of a heroes' feast spell. If it cannot be redeemed, a chained angel is a storm of destruction.",
    "Angel of Judgment: With faces of light and stern appraisal, these angels see both sides and render a verdict._  \nAngels of judgment are cosmic agents of balance. Unlike most angels, they exist to enforce equality between law and chaos. They prefer to solve disputes verbally but use force when prudent.  \n**Two-Faced.** Each angel of judgment bears two aspects: a dispassionate angel and a fiendish judge. When called to violence by the heavenly host or infernal legions, its dispassionate face changes to that of an avenging angel.  \n**Witnesses to History.** In times of turmoil and upheaval, angels of judgment watch over events. While observing, the angel is a stoic spectator, intervening only if it sees a threat to universal harmony. Even then, they prefer to send Open Game License",
    "Angelic Enforcer: A gold-furred, lion-headed angel with white wings gives an intense stare, releasing a roar as it raises a flaming greatsword._  \nAngelic enforcers are lion-headed celestials that hunt rogue angels.  \n**Divine Mission.** Angelic enforcers are made from souls selected for their unwavering adherence to the tenants of law and good. These elite angels have a special task: police other angels that go rogue. If an angel breaks one of its god\u2019s tenets but remains good at heart, the enforcers usually only seek to capture the offending celestial to stand trial in the upper planes. If an angel becomes fully corrupted by evil, one or more enforcers are sent to destroy the fallen celestial.  \n**Nothing Gets in the Way.** Angelic enforcers show no mercy to any creature or obstacle between them and their quarries. Those who obstruct the enforcers stand in the way of divine justice and are therefore considered agents of evil. Any killings or collateral damage done by enforcers are usually seen as the fault of their quarry for stepping out of line in the first place.  \n**Immortal Nature.** An angelic enforcer doesn\u2019t require food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Angler Worm: _As patient as a fisherman, the angler worm lights a beacon in the darkness and waits for its next meal._  \n**Silk Snares.** The angler worm burrows into the ceilings of caves and tunnels, where it creates snares from strong silk threads coated with sticky mucus. It then lures prey into its snares while remaining safely hidden itself, emerging only to feed. With dozens of snares, food always comes to the angler worm eventually.",
    "Animated Bearskin Rug: A shaggy rug made from the skin of a bear suddenly rises up like a billowing sheet. The head snaps its jaws and the whole thing lunges forward, flat and threatening._  \nAnimated bearskin rugs are exactly what their name suggests: bearskin rugs given life by magic.  \n**Inn Protection.** Inns and hunting lodges in remote locations often hire mages to make animated bearskin rugs. The rugs serve as seemingly harmless decorations that can instantly turn into guardians to drive away burglars, or into bouncers to break up bar fights.  \n**Bearserk.** There are rare cases of animated bearskin rugs suddenly going berserk and refusing to follow the commands of their masters. It is unknown what triggers such violence in the constructs. Berserk rugs need to be put down swiftly, as they attack any creature they notice.  \n**Construct Nature.** An animated bearskin rug doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Aniwye: The ogre shifts and contorts, dropping to all fours as it takes the form of a vicious bear-sized skunk with razor-sharp claws and teeth._  \n**Noxious Terrors.** The aniwye is a magical monstrosity that resembles a cross between an enormous skunk and a wolverine. They go out of their way to hunt humans and gnomes, particularly those tied to the natural world. Aside from their savage claws and teeth, the aniwye can also spray a deadly musk at opponents, the poison burning the eyes and lungs of those who inhale it. Aniwye also use this musk to mark their territory\u2014a tree trunk or boulder covered in fresh musk is a sure sign an aniwye is not far away.  \n**Unsubtle Shapeshifters.** Aniwye can shapeshift into an Open Game License",
    "Anubian: _An anubian\u2019s swirling sand comes together to form a snarling, canine-faced humanoid whose eyes shine with an eerie, blue glow. Anubians are elementals summoned to guard tombs or protect treasures._  \n**Piles of Dust.** An anubian at rest resembles a pile of sand or dust, often strewn about an already dusty location. When active, it rises up to form a muscular humanoid with the head of a jackal. A destroyed anubian collapses into an inert pile of sand.  \n**Death to the Unarmored.** In combat, anubians prefer to fight unarmored foes rather than creatures wearing armor. They associate unarmored creatures with spellcasters, and their latent resentment over centuries of being summoned as servants drives them to attack such figures when they aren\u2019t shackled by magical bondage.  \n**Sandstorm Tag Teams.** Anubians fight effectively as teams, using their haboob attacks to corner and isolate the most vulnerable targets.  \n**Elemental Nature.** An anubian doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Anzu: A giant raptor roars out its fury in spouts of fire and scalding water while lightning crackles through its feathers._  \n**Territorial.** Anzu are fierce and territorial predators, claiming ranges along the edges of deserts, wide grasslands, or high mountains. Extremely long-lived, they mate for life, producing two or three eggs every decade.  \n**Elemental Birthright.** Offspring of a wind god or primordial wind spirit, anzu are the personification of the south wind, lightning, and the driving monsoon. Uniquely tied to the elements of fire, water, and wind, they react poorly to weather-altering magic.",
    "Apau Perape: _Apau Perape Sharp teeth fill this large, demonic ape\u2019s mouth. Its long, muscular arms stretch to the ground, ending in wickedly curved claws._  \n_**Servants of Fire.**_ These black-furred gorilla demons serve only their demon lord. Their final loyalty is unshakable, though sometimes they serve others for a time\u2014 and they have no fear of fire, gleefully setting fire to villages and crops if their master is snubbed or insulted.  \n_**Fearless Attackers.**_ The apau perape are fearless and savage, living for battle. Once in combat, their morale never breaks. Like their master, they have an insatiable hunger and do not leave any dead behind, consuming even their bones.  \n_**Eyes of Fire.**_ When this demon is angered, its eyes glow a deep, disturbing red, unlike any natural ape.",
    "Apaxrusl: Thick desert grit encrusts a decayed form as it stalks forward, clouds of biting sand flitting about at its behest._  \nApaxrusl, or sand drudges, are created through dark rituals that merge a corpse with desert sand.  \n**Soul Infusion.** The rituals used to create an apaxrusl call for infusing damned souls into the sand, and would-be creators regularly make bargains with demons to acquire this unique component. Oftentimes, the deal goes poorly for the creator, leaving the resulting apaxrusl to wander the desert without a master.  \n**Abyssal Intelligence.** The damned souls filling the apaxrusl give it intelligence, but its constructed form keeps it loyal, making it a valuable asset to its creator. Necromancers often create apaxrusl to lead small groups of undead on specific tasks, confident in the construct\u2019s ability to execute orders and lead the undead while away from the direct control of the necromancer.  \n**Construct Nature.** The apaxrusl doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Arachnocrat: A portly gentleman with slender arms and legs keeps his face and hands carefully concealed._  \nArachnocrats are spider-like fiends who enjoy masquerading as members of high society. They eat haute cuisine and drink fine wine in the company of humans.  \n**Finer Tastes.** Viewing the wealth and standing of their victims as the greatest measure of taste, these devils delight in aristocratic prey, though they most often feed on the liquefied innards of servants of the aristocracy to avoid detection. They use local spiders as spies and informants to get closer to their quarries or discover dark secrets their quarries would rather keep hidden. Ever patient in their schemes of corruption, arachnocrats often court their quarries over months of theatre, dinner parties, and elaborate balls.  \n**Hidden in Plain Sight.** Arachnocrats are adept at disguising themselves as aristocrats. Their most noticeable features are their clawed hands and their spider-like faces, which they cover with gloves, masks, scarves, voluminous robes, and similar attire. The eccentricities of the well-to-do help to cast off any suspicion over their odd coverings.  \n**As Good As Gold.** The arachnocrat\u2019s preferred prey comes at a high price. Blessed by the Arch-Devil of Greed, Mammon, arachnocrats have a second stomach that can turn common rocks into faux gemstones. The fiends vomit up the gemstones after digesting the rocks for a few months, and they use the gemstones to fund their endeavors. The counterfeit nature of the gems is detectable by only true craftsmen.",
    "Arboreal Grappler: _Long, simian arms snake through the trees like furred serpents, dangling from a shaggy, striped ape in the leafy canopy above and trying to snare those below._  \nAn arboreal grappler is a malformed creation of the gods, a primate whose legs warped into long, muscular tentacles covered in shaggy, red fur.  \n**Carry Prey to the Heights.** Arboreal grapplers use their long limbs to snatch prey and drag it behind them as they use their powerful forelimbs to ascend to the highest canopy. Their victims are constricted until their struggles cease and then are devoured. Their flexible tentacles are ill-suited for terrestrial movement; they must drag themselves clumsily across open ground too wide to swing across.  \n**Clans in the Canopy.** Arboreal grappler tribes build family nests decorated with bones and prized relics of past hunts. These nests are built high in the jungle canopy, typically 80 feet or more above the ground. Clans of 40 or more spread across crude villages atop the trees; in such large settlements, a third of the population are juveniles. These nests are difficult to spot from the ground; a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check is required. A creature observing an arboreal grappler as it climbs into or out of a nest has advantage on the check.  \n**Carnivorous Elf Hunters.** Grapplers are carnivorous and prefer humanoid flesh, elves in particular. Some suggest this arises from hatred as much as from hunger, a cruel combination of fascination and revulsion for the walking limbs of humanoid creatures.",
    "Archmage: **Archmages** are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.\nAn archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.",
    "Aridni: _Both more rugged and more ruthless than normal pixies, the aridni are an especially greedy breed of fey bandits and kidnappers._  \n**Pale Archers.** These ashen-faced fey with gray moth wings fire green-glowing arrows with a sneer and a curse. Aridni prefer ranged combat whenever possible, and they are quite difficult to lure into melee. They sometimes accept a personal challenge o respond to accusations of cowardice.  \n**Caravan Raiders.** They\u2019ve developed different magical abilities that aid them well when they raid caravans for captives to enslave and sell; charming foes into slavery is a favorite tactic.  \n**Wealth for Status.** They delight in taking plunder from humans and dwarves, not so much for its own sake but as a sign of their power over mortals, and their contempt for those who lack fey blood.",
    "Asanbosam: _An asasonbosam is a hirsute hulk with bulging, bloodshot eyes, often perched high in a tree and ready to seize unwary passersby with talons like rusty hooks._  \n**Iron Hooks and Fangs.** They resemble hairy ogres from the waist up, but with muscular and flexible legs much longer than those of an ogre. These odd appendages end in feet with hooklike talons, and both the creature\u2019s hooks and its fangs are composed of iron rather than bone or other organic material. These iron fangs and claws mark an asanbosam\u2019s age, not just by their size but also by their color. The youngest specimens have shiny gray hooks and fangs, while older ones have discolored and rusty ones.  \n**Iron Eaters.** The asanbosam diet includes iron in red meat, poultry, fish, and leaf vegetables, and\u2014in times of desperation\u2014 grinding iron filings off their own hooks to slake their cravings. The asanbosams\u2019 taste for fresh blood and humanoid flesh led to the folklore that they are vampiric (not true).  \n**Tree Lairs.** Asanbosams spend most of their lives in trees, where they build nestlike houses or platforms of rope and rough planks. They don\u2019t fear magic; most tribes count at least one spellcaster among its members.",
    "Ash Drake: _A lean and dull-scaled ash drake often perches on a chimney as if it just crawled out, its tail still hanging into the chimney as smoke billows out._  \n**Chimney Nesting.** Ash drakes clog chimney flues and delight in dusting crowds with thick, choking ash and soot, while the drakes laugh with sneering, wheezing tones. To placate the creatures, owners of smelters and smithies leave large piles of ash for the drakes to play in, with the hope they leave the shop and its workers alone. Anyone hunting ash drakes finds them very difficult to attack in their cramped lairs because the creatures blend in with the surroundings. Ash drakes often befriend kobolds, who have little trouble appeasing the beasts and appreciate the added security they bring.  \n**Hunt Strays and Pets.** Ash drakes eat rats and stray animals, although few can resist snatching an unattended, possibly beloved pet. Contrary to popular opinion, this drake doesn\u2019t consume ash, but enjoys a pile of ash like a cat would catnip, rolling around in it and becoming wild-eyed. Anyone who disrupts such play becomes the target of the creature\u2019s intensely hot and sooty breath weapon.  \nWhile an ash drake is three feet long with a four-foot long tail that seems to trail off into smoke, it weighs less than one might expect\u2014approximately ten lb. Every third winter, when chimneys are active, a male drake leaves his lair to find a mate. If the new couple roosts in a city or town, the nearby streets know it, as the air becomes nearly unbreathable with soot. The resulting eggs are left in a suitable chimney, and one of the parents protects the young until they leave the nest at two years of age.  \n**Volcanic Haunts.** Ash drakes outside a city live in or near volcanic plateaus, and mutter about the lack of neighbors to bully. In the wild, an ash drake may partner with a red dragon or flame dragon, since the dragon provides its lesser cousin with plenty of ash.",
    "Ash Phoenix: A massive raptor made of ash and shadow screeches as it dives, its eyes like glowing coals. Impossibly, it stops its dive mere feet from the ground, and its powerful wings whip up ash that carries the chill of the grave._  \nAsh phoenixes are the animated ashes of mass funerary pyres, which seek the eradication of all life around their birth pyres.  \n**Cremated Birth.** For an ash phoenix to be created, a group of humanoids must be burned in a mass pyre in an area tainted with necrotic energy, and the blood of a magical avian, such as an Open Game License",

    "Astral Devourer: A swarm of strange, faceless gray snakes flies through the air\u2014wingless, as if through water. Their mouths are rasping irises of gnashing fangs, and the sides of each snake are lined with milky, unblinking eyes._  \nWhen enough serpents on the Astral Plane gather, they form a collective creature called an astral devourer. The astral devourer has a hive mind made up of all the minds of its component creatures and possesses a great cunning that makes it more adept at hunting.  \n**All for the Whole.** The individual astral serpents that make up the astral devourer have no thoughts or wills of their own, and the collective freely uses the individuals as weapons. The astral devourer often flings serpents at hard-to-reach prey to consume it. The flung serpents return to the astral devourer, bringing the consumed life force back to the collective. When food is particularly scarce or the devourer is in danger, it can split into subgroups of the main collective, feeding the individuals while keeping the whole safely dispersed.  \n**Planar Hunters.** Hunger constantly drives astral devourers. They love the taste of sentient planar travelers, and they roam the multiverse, favoring desolate landscapes. Reports indicate they\u2019re adept at finding portals between worlds and relentlessly hunt prey through these portals.",
    "Astri: Human hands sit at the ends of the raccoon-headed creature\u2019s four short legs. It flicks its banded tail as it turns toward cries for help, setting its vivid blue eyes on those in need._  \n**Good Samaritans.** Astri range the badlands and deserts of the Material Plane, seeking opportunities to assist lost and dying travelers. When an astri encounters people in distress, it works to grant them the assistance they need\u2014be it food, healing, or a safe place to rest\u2014and remains until they no longer require its help.  \n**Bringers of Hope.** When they aren\u2019t helping individuals or small groups, astri quietly watch over villages in their territories. They keep the surroundings clear of threats, aerate the soil, and dig out wells in places with limited access to clean water. Astri become quite fond of the settlements under their protection and take pride in the residents\u2019 successes.  \n**Enemies of Greed.** Mercenary behavior offends the sensibilities of astri, but they understand many people have strong selfish streaks. Astri counter this selfishness by magically enforcing the desire to help others. Before an astri assists an intelligent creature, it asks the creature to promise to do good deeds over the next few weeks. If a creature won\u2019t make the promise, the astri still assists, but the creature must contend with the _geas_ that may be attached to the helping hand.",
    "Attercroppe: Emerging from the water with barely a ripple is a slender, serpentine creature with human arms and a wicked grin on its wide, lizard-like mouth. The creature is no more than a foot long and has pale green skin and blood-red eyes._  \n**Ophidian Fey.** While attercroppes have a vaguely snakelike appearance, they are not cold-blooded creatures and have nothing but disdain for true snakes and reptilian creatures like lizardfolk and nagas. They hate other creatures just as much and despise everything that is beautiful and pure in the world.  \n**Poisonous Fey.** Attercroppes radiate supernatural poison from their bodies. While their poisonous aura cannot harm living creatures directly, it is remarkably good at poisoning fresh sources of drinking water, such as wells and ponds. Rivers, streams, and lakes are usually too large for a single attercroppe to poison, but several attercroppes working together can poison a larger body of still or slow-moving water.  \n**Fey Enemies.** Water-dwelling fey, such as Open Game License",
    "August Rooster: An amalgam of various bird species crows proudly as it hops forward._  \n**Chimeric Avian.** The body of an august rooster is nearly human-sized with the head of a pheasant, the body of a perching duck, the tail of a peacock, the legs of a heron, the beak of a parrot, and the wings of a swallow. There is wide variation among specimens of this hybrid, however, with different creators replacing portions of the creature depending on the material they have on hand during the creation process. Most august roosters are created entirely of avian material, though specimens evidencing snake necks, turtle shells, and stag bodies have been encountered. Once created, an august rooster can reproduce with any species of bird, which usually results in an exotic-looking example of the bird. Only three percent of eggs fertilized or laid by an august rooster hatch into another august rooster. An august rooster fused by magic is full grown at creation, while one that hatches naturally grows to adulthood over the span of six to eight months.  \n**Selfish and Self-serving.** August roosters display the basest instincts of their creators, and they have the mental faculties and temperament of a spoiled, malicious child. Their sole concern is their own comfort, and they use their natural gifts to force nearby humanoids to tend to their wants and needs. Young august roosters are brazen about their collections of servants, often working the servants to exhaustion with constant demands. More mature individuals have a strong sense of self-preservation and have their servants see to their needs only when they know it will not raise suspicion.",
    "Aurora Horribilis: A ribbon of light flies just above the ground, its gleam flickering in and out of view as it emits a discordant tune._  \n**Hidden Among Polar Lights.** Though auroras horribilis can manifest anywhere on a world, they prefer to dance and sing within naturally-occurring auroras. When they notice admirers of boreal lights, they descend from the sky to share their songs. Unfortunately, they are unaware of the bewilderment their songs invoke in listeners and are subsequently surprised by hostile action toward them.  \n**Terrible Harbinger.** While an aurora\u2019s direct effects on most creatures is cause for alarm, the aurora\u2019s presence is typically a prelude to something worse. Auroras tend to attach themselves to the forefront of a wave of devastation wrought by unknowable beings. Given the nature of such beings, auroras can precede the beings by days or even centuries.  \n**Lessons from the Void.** Because auroras horribilis travel with ancient beings from the Void, they hear many secrets about the universe, which they incorporate into their songs. An inability to understand the incomprehensible knowledge contained in their songs often induces madness in their listeners. This makes the auroras valuable to apocalypse cults welcoming the beings they herald, as well as to the desperate who seek to avert the coming catastrophe.",
    "Automata Devil: _A nightmare wrapped in chains and built of cutting cogs and whirring gears, an automata devil howls like a hurricane in battle. Once chain devils, automata devils have been promoted to greater power._  \n**Guards and Overseers.** Sometimes called castigas, automata devils are made to monitor others. They are often put in charge of prisoners or infernal factories.  \n**Pierced by Chain and Wire.** This slender creature\u2019s skin is pierced with barbs, sharp nails, and coils of wire, which have been threaded through its flesh. Chains are buried under blisters and scabs. This infernal horror\u2019s eyelids\u2014both front and back pairs\u2014have been sewn back with wire, while six arms ending in large grasping hands erupt from its shoulders.  \n**Coiled Metal Whips.** The creature\u2019s back is broad and massive. Its head is a black mass ending in two large mandibles. By its side, it carries a huge coiled whip that squirms like a snake and is said to scent lies and treachery. The creature\u2019s stomach opens up like a second mouth, filled with spines.",
    "Avalanche Screamer: Ice shards scrape together as this creature moves on its many icicle-like legs. The ice making up much of its body parts to reveal several toothy maws, and a scream erupts from deep within the creature._  \n**Primordial Beings.** Avalanche screamers were apex predators when the world was younger and covered in ice. As the world thawed, avalanche screamers fled to mountain peaks and polar regions to hunt smaller prey. Avalanche screamer lairs contain a jumble of bones from their victims but have no other commonalities.  \n**Devious Hunter.** A versatile predator, the avalanche screamer can attack its prey from the ground beneath or from cliffs and trees above. It prefers to pick off its victims one at a time, grabbing stragglers at the back of a group and killing them before returning to the group. When it must face multiple foes simultaneously, it uses its scream to inflict harm on as many targets as possible. In unstable areas, the sound can cause avalanches, which the avalanche screamer rides out unscathed. It then uses its ability to detect vibrations to locate survivors, tunnel its way toward them, and devour them.  \n**Summer Hibernation.** Because avalanche screamers become lethargic and vulnerable in warmer temperatures, they hide themselves during the brief summers in their mountaintop and polar habitats. In preparation for their summer slumbers, they aggressively hunt prey, fattening themselves or stockpiling in their lairs. As a precaution against hunters that might follow them to their lairs, avalanche screamers often collect their food from miles away and tunnel through the ground to leave no tracks. Those who manage to track the creatures and hope to easily dispatch them while they are sluggish find avalanche screamers quickly shake their torpor to defend themselves.",
    "Aviere: A small bird with a fiery belly perches on the shoulder of the temple\u2019s acolyte, singing a divine song._  \nAvieres are fiery songbirds created by good deities and sent to holy sites on the Material Plane as protectors and teachers. They innately know the tenets of their deities and encourage those around them to uphold the tenets. They dislike leaving the area they were sent to tend, but they sometimes venture out to heal or evangelize passersby.  \n**Songbirds.** Locations containing avieres are always filled with beautiful music, as they sing the hymns of their deities at all hours of the day. In doing so, they heal and uplift their surroundings, leading to healthier flora and fauna and calmer weather in the area.  \n**Temple Assistants.** Avieres in temples spend most days aiding the temple\u2019s priests and priestesses, especially in coaching acolytes or those new to the faith. They take great pleasure in assisting scribes who are writing their deity\u2019s teachings, acting as a light source while singing the teachings to the scribes.",
    "Avulzor: A horrid-looking bipedal creature with cracked, leathery skin and long arms and legs\u2014ending in wicked, flensing talons\u2014rears up. A trio of unblinking purple eyes is situated in the monster\u2019s chest, and its neck ends in a nest of lamprey-like heads. It wears a kilt of humanoid bones that rattles unnervingly as it moves._  \n**Horrors from Beyond Reality.** Avulzors are hideous aberrations native to a dimension inundated with necrotic energy. There they weave plans for dominating the other planes of existence, launching expeditionary forces into other worlds to kidnap humanoids for experimentation, steal useful magical devices, or destroy perceived threats. Their reasons for doing so are largely unknown, yet they despise all other living creatures.  \n**Masters of Bone.** While avulzors hate all life, they have a disturbingly accurate understanding of humanoid anatomy and use this knowledge to grant their undead constructs extra power. They can also shape bone as if it were putty, transforming an ogre\u2019s pelvis into a usable chair or a dwarf \u2019s teeth and ribs into a complex musical instrument.

    "Azza Gremlin: _These tiny, hairless, rail-thin creatures crackle with static electricity. Arcs of lightning snap between their long ears._  \n**Lightning Lovers.** Azza gremlins live among storm clouds, lightning-based machinery, and other places with an abundance of lightning.  \n**Magnetic Flight.** Although wingless, their light bodies are perfectly attuned to electromagnetic fields, giving them buoyancy and flight. They love playing in thunderstorms and riding lightning bolts between the clouds or between clouds and the ground. They feed off lightning and love to see its effects on other creatures.  \n**Work with Spellcasters.** Although they aren\u2019t much more than hazardous pests by themselves, more malicious creatures and spellcasters that use lightning as a weapon work with azza gremlins to amplify their own destructiveness.  \nAzza gremlins stand 12 to 18 inches tall and weigh approximately 8 lb.",
    "Backup Holler Spider: While the chitinous horn-like protrusion makes holler spiders appear comical, they can use it to release a loud sound, calling their masters when they detect trespassers. Unlike most spiders, Open Game License",
    "Bagiennik: _With webbed claws, bulbous eyes, and two nostril-slits that ooze an oily black substance, the creature is not quite hideous\u2014but it might be, if most of it wasn\u2019t concealed by a thick coating of muck and mud._  \n**Bathing Uglies.** When a bagiennik is alone, it spends its time bathing in local springs, rivers, and marshes. The creature sifts through the muck and silt, extracting substances that enhance its oily secretions. If anything disturbs the creature during its languorous bathing sessions, it angrily retaliates. Once a bagiennik has bathed for four hours it seeks a target for mischief or charity.  \n**Unpredictable Moods.** One never knows what to expect with a bagiennik. The same creature might aid an injured traveler one day, smear that person with corrosive, acidic oil the next day, and then extend tender care to the burned victim of its own psychotic behavior. If the creature feels beneficent, it heals injured animals or even diseased or injured villagers. If a bagiennik visits a settlement, the ill and infirm approach it cautiously while everyone else hides to avoid provoking its wrath. When a bagiennik leaves its bath in an angry mood, it raves and seeks out animals or humanoids to spray its oil onto. If a victim drops to 0 hit points, the foul-tempered bagiennik applies healing oil to stabilize them, grumbling all the while.  \n**Acid Oils.** Collecting a dead bagiennik\u2019s black oils must be done within an hour of the creature\u2019s death. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check yields one vial of acid, or two vials if the result was 20 or higher. A bagiennik can use these chemicals either to heal or to harm, but no alchemist or healer has figured out how to reproduce the healing effects. Other than their acidic effect, the secretions lose all potency within moments of being removed from a bagiennik. A bagiennik weighs 250 lb., plus a coating of 20 to 50 lb. of mud and muck.",
    "Baliri Demon: A muscular humanoid with gray-black skin and the oversized head of a donkey lumbers forward. The monster\u2019s eyes and tongue loll from its head, and its arms end in crimson crab-like pincers that snap together with incredible strength._  \n**Tormented Killers.** A baliri demon is created when a humanoid suffers at the hands of family or peers and turns to one of the demon lords for succor and bloody retribution. The result is both catastrophic and deadly, and the victim of the abuse is often executed for their dark dealings. It is at this moment that the demon lord snatches up the victim\u2019s soul and transforms it into a baliri demon, a savage and remorseless killer that seeks to spread misery in its wake.  \n**Braying Apostles.** A baliri demon is a devout servant of the demon lord that created it, stridently extolling the virtues of its demonic master even as it butchers and defiles anyone who stands in its way. The loud braying prayers and hymns of a baliri demon carry for miles across the blasted Abyssal landscape and fill the hearts of mortals and lesser demons alike with dread. Baliri demons are not picky when it comes to choosing their victims but have a preference for anyone who resembles an aggressor from their previous life.",
    "Balloon Spider: Honed by evolutionary processes, the balloon spider has perfected the art of ballooning, floating through the air held aloft by strands of webbing suspended by electromagnetic fields. Electrified mandibles grant these spiders precise control over nearby electromagnetic fields and a potent weapon for shocking its prey.  \nBeneath their hunting grounds, the corpses and bones of their prey lie sparsely coated with stray strands of blue webbing. These remains wobble and glide across the ground of their own accord, caught in stray eddies in the electromagnetic field. The webbing of a balloon spider is prized by arcanists as a component for spells and the construction of magical flying machines.",
    "Bandit: **Bandits** rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry. \n**Pirates** are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.",
    "Bandit Captain: It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The **bandit captain** has these qualities in spades. \nIn addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the **pirate captain** is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis. \nMore than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.",
    "Barometz: This creature resembles a large horned goat covered in thick green moss. A vine trails from the beast\u2019s udder to a nearby tree. The creature smells of fresh bread and floral grapes._  \n**Born of Fruit.** The barometz is a strange plant-like monster that arises spontaneously from a normal fruit tree, some say as the result of ancient druidic magic or fey meddling. A fruit tree bearing a barometz grows an unusually large fruit that soon drops from the tree and bursts open to reveal the goat-like creature. The barometz remains attached to its parent plant by a vine and spends its life clearing the area around the fruit tree of weeds and other noxious plants.  \n**A Feast for Kings.** The flesh of a barometz is considered a delicacy by almost all humanoids and giants, and few barometz survive for long once they are discovered by a band of trollkin hunters or foraging hill giants. Elves and other woodland humanoids have attempted to breed barometz, without success. The creature does not reproduce naturally and the methods by which they appear are still unknown.",
    "Bastet Temple Cat: _A slim feline far larger than any house cat slips from the shadows. Its coat glistens like ink as it chirps, and its tail flicks teasingly as its golden eyes observe the doings in its temple._  \n**Bred for Magic.** Temple cats of Bastet are thought by some to be celestials, but they are a terrestrial breed, created by the priesthood through generations of enchantment.  \n**Lazy Temple Pets.** By day, temple cats laze about their shrines and porticos, searching out attention from the faithful and occasionally granting boons when it suits then.  \n**Fierce Shrine Guardians.** By night, they serve as guardians in their temples, inciting would-be thieves to come close before viciously mauling them. More than one would-be rogue has met his or her fate at the claws and teeth of these slim, black-furred beasts. Bastet temple cats are fierce enemies of temple dogs.",
    "Bearfolk: _Although it has the head of a shaggy bear, this humanoid creature wears armor and carries a battleaxe in one massive, clawed hand and a warhammer in the other. It\u2019s a solid slab of muscle that towers imposingly over most humans._  \nThe hulking bearfolk are intimidating creatures. Brutish and powerful, they combine features of humanoid beings and bears. Their heads are ursine with heavy jaws and sharp teeth. Dark fur covers their bodies, which are packed with muscle. Adult bearfolk stand at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 600 pounds.  \n**Passionate and Volatile.** Boisterous and jovial, the bearfolk are a people of extremes. They celebrate with great passion and are quick to explosive anger. Settling differences with wrestling matches that leave permanent scars is common, as is seeing two bloodied bearfolk sharing a cask of mead and a raucous song after such a scuffle.",
    "Bearing Golem: A scattering of metal ball bearings coalesces into a constantly shifting humanoid shape._  \nMade up of thousands of ball bearings, a bearing golem can assume nearly any shape it chooses, though it always remains an amalgamation of metal pellets.  \n**Thievish Inspiration.** The first bearing golem was created when a wizard saw a thief foiling the traps in its tower with ball bearings. After disposing of the thief, the wizard collected the metal balls and realized their purpose could be improved if the bearings spread themselves. A later variant used caltrops instead creating the Open Game License",
    "Befouled Weird: Water filled with algae, worms, and other detritus rises up in a serpentine form. It reeks of stagnation and rot._  \n**Corrupted Water Elementals.** When aquatic parasites invade a water elemental, they take control of it and seek to propagate. The host becomes a befouled weird, providing protection and an ideal environment for the parasites. It prefers warm, marshy environments where the parasites are more at home. While the weird can carry any parasite, it most commonly acts as a host for brain-eating amoebas.  \n**Exiles to the Material Plane.** Water elementals prevent befouled weirds from infesting the Plane of Water. Otherwise, the tainted creatures infuse pure water elementals with their parasites. Water elementals knowledgeable about such things equate a plague of befouled weirds to Open Game License",

Only the desperate or the suicidal travel to their volcanic temple-islands._  \nA demon lord bred the cruelty of a demon with the cunning of a human and the ferocity of an ape into his people, the behtu (BAY-too), who carry his worship from island to island.  \n**Temple Builders.** The behtus raise shrines to their demon lord wherever they go. Some are kept and prosper, while others fall into decay and return to the jungle.  \n**Ichor Drinkers.** In his volcanic temples, the demon lord\u2019s idols weep his ichorous demon blood, which the behtus use to create infusions that give them inhuman strength and speed. The behtus also use the infusions to etch demonic tattoos that grant them infernal powers and protection.  \n**Scaly Mounts.** The behtus breed demonic iguanas as war mounts (treat as giant lizards). The most powerful behtu sorcerers and druids have been known to ride large crimson drakes and small flame dragons as personal mounts.",

With their pale skin and translucent wings, they blend perfectly into their snowy environment; only their beady black eyes stand out against the snow and ice._  \nThese malevolent ice-sprites are a plague upon the people of snowy climates, ambushing unwary prey with icy arrows and freezing spell-like powers.  \n**Servants of the North Wind.** Known as \u201cpatzinaki\u201d in some dialects of Dwarvish, the beli are the servants of winter gods and venerate the north wind as Boreas and other gods of darker aspects. They are frequent allies with the fraughashar.  \n**Feast Crashers.** Beli especially delight in disrupting feasts and making off with the holiday cakes\u2014the least deadly of their malicious pranks.  \n**Fear of Druids.** They have an irrational fear of northern druids and their snow bear companions.",

Despite its great stature, it seems strangely gentle, with a serene, almost soothing presence. Nothing could be further from the truth; the berstuc is a murderous demon that stalks woodlands and jungles of the Material Plane.  \n_**Poisoned Fruit.**_ Berstuc prowl forests in search of travellers to torment. A berstuc demon poses as a benevolent, or at least indifferent, wood spirit to gain the trust of mortals. It allows itself to be persuaded to help lost travellers (reluctantly) or to lead them to their destinations. Once it draws its unwitting prey deep into the woods, it strikes.  \n_**Verdant Nature.**_ The berstuc doesn\u2019t require food or sleep.",
    "Black Crier: This skeletal figure is dressed in the style of a town crier. It carries an elaborate silver bell in its bony hands, and its skull gleams white in the moonlight._  \n**Heralds of Calamity.** The black crier is an undead that appears hours, days, or even months before a great catastrophe. The larger the catastrophe, the earlier the black crier appears.  \n**Servants of Fate.** Black criers are not malicious or vengeful undead and exist to warn of coming danger. They defend themselves if attacked but don\u2019t pursue fleeing opponents.  \n**Mute Messengers.** Despite their name, black criers cannot speak; instead, they use cryptic hand gestures or other mysterious signs to warn people of the impending calamity.  \n**Undead Nature.** A black crier doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.  \n\n## Portents of Disaster\n\n  \nA black crier is always accompanied by signs of impending disaster.

    "Bleakheart: A humanoid in blurred gray tones settles in the shadowed corner of a dimly-lit room and disappears from view._  \n**Poor Players.** Some people are driven to perform. They crave the adulation of their peers, the attention of strangers, the promise of fame and the immortality it brings. Unfortunately, not every such artist has the talent and perseverance to succeed. Whenever a minstrel flees a stage pelted by rotting produce and ends their life in despair, or an actor\u2019s alcoholism leads them to an early grave after a scathing review, a bleakheart is born. Once a bleakheart rises, it seeks to spread hopelessness and create new bleakhearts.  \n**Walking Shadows.** Bleakhearts exist on the fringes of the societies where they once lived. When they are not skulking in the dark, the citizenry ignores them as they would any other drifter. They linger around taverns, theaters, and other places the living visit for entertainment. Sometimes the sight and sound of merriment rouses the bleakhearts from cold despair to hot rage. The resulting carnage invariably leads to the destruction of the originating bleakheart and the creation of several new ones.  \n**Familiar Faces.** A bleakheart gains grim satisfaction in causing distress to the living, especially those who have recently experienced joy. By day, they lurk in deeply shadowed areas of settlements, usually around places of entertainment, and skim the thoughts of passersby. When a bleakheart detects someone who is elated, it follows them home for further observation. While its victim sleeps, the bleakheart probes their mind, causing the victim nightmares about the subject of their happiness. Once the victim awakens, its joy turned to pain, the bleakheart disguises itself as the personage who once brought the victim joy and reveals itself. Even while magically disguised, a bleakheart appears disquietingly out of focus.  \n**Undead Nature.** A bleakheart doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Blemmyes: _This headless giant has a large mouth in its chest, with eyes bulging out on either side of it._  \n**Always Hungry.** Blemmyes are brutes that savor humanoid flesh, and they see all humanoids as potential meals. Some even have the patience to tend groups of humans, goblins, or halflings like unruly herds, farming them for food and fattening them up for maximum succulence.  \n**Cannibals.** So great is their hideous hunger that blemmyes are not above eating their own kind; they cull and consume the weakest specimens of their race when other food is scarce. The most terrible habit of these monsters is that they seldom wait for their food to die, or even for a battle to conclude, before launching into a grisly feast.",

Her face is a misshapen mass of leathery flesh with a bulbous nose, like a gnarled knot on an old oak tree._  \n**Vampiric Origins.** Blood hags have long skulked on the fringes of society. The first blood hags appeared when a red hag mated with a mad vampire archmage\u00ad\u00ad\u2014their offspring became the first blood hags.

    "Blood Imp: Blood drips from the lips of this crimson fiend._  \n**Agents of Death.** Blood imps are the devilish servants of gods of blood, death, and decay. On the Material Plane they are often found hastening the deaths of sacrifices and drinking spilled blood in the names of their masters.  \n**Temple Bane.** Blood imps despise the temples of gods of life and healing. The devils are driven to a mad rage when close to the altar of such a deity and go out of their way to defile or destroy it.",
    "Bloodsapper: This hairless, dog-like creature has pale skin, an enormous bladder underneath its throat, and a conical head with two deepset, black eyes. A long, thick red tongue, ending in a hollow spike, flicks from its shrew-like mouth._  \n**Ravenous Blood Eaters.** The bloodsapper is a vampiric creature with an unrelenting thirst for blood. While it can drink the blood of animals and wild beasts, it vastly prefers the blood of sapient bipedal creatures, such as giants and humanoids. When it catches prey, it uses its long, spiked tongue to impale and drain them until they are little more than husks. Due to its appetite, the bloodsapper frequently comes into conflict with other creatures reliant on blood such as Open Game License",
    "Bloodstone Sentinel: A humanoid statue made of green stone streaked with red steps forward, its long, curved claws reaching out. Its face is blank of features except two deep eye sockets that drip fresh blood like tears._  \nEvil cults exsanguinate sacrifices over specially prepared bloodstone statues, infusing the life force of the victims into the rock and granting it life. These sentinels are driven to see more blood spilled, whether by their own hands, those of their masters, or even those of their enemies.  \n**Blood Calls Blood.** The blood infused into the sentinel perpetually leaks out, a representation of the agony that created the construct. This agony pulls on nearby creatures, drawing out vital fluids and ripping minor wounds into great injuries. The sentinel stores this blood inside itself, and the red veins in its stone become more prevalent the more blood it stores.  \n**Mindless Fury.** Those who create bloodstone sentinels invariably see power through the spilling of blood and utilize the construct to spread their faith.

Bolotis use their magical vortex to immobilize their victims and drag them to a watery death. They delight in storing up larders of victims under winter ice or under logs.  \n**Fond of Allies.** Bolotis sometimes team up with vodyanoi, miremals, and will-o\u2019-wisps to create cunning ambushes. They are happy with a single kill at a time.",
    "Bone Collective: _A bone collective is almost a fluid; its thousands of tiny bones coalesce into a humanoid form only to disperse in a clattering swarm the next moment. Their tiny bones rustle when they move, a quiet sound similar to sand sliding down a dune._  \n**Spies and Sneaks.** Bone collectives are not primarily fighters, although they swarm well enough. They prefer to spy and skulk. When cornered, however, they fight without fear or hesitation, seeking to strip the flesh from their foes.  \n**Zombie Mounts.** Bone collectives\u2019 long finger bones and hooked claws help them climb onto zombie mounts and control them. Bone collectives almost always wear robes or cloaks, the better to pretend to be humanoid. They understand that most creatures find their nature disturbing.  \n**Feed on Society.** Bone collectives join the societies around them, whether human, goblin, or ghoul. They prey on the living and the dead, using them to replenish lost bones. Occasionally, they choose to serve necromancers, darakhul, some vampires, and liches, all of whom offers magical attunements and vile joys to the collective. They dislike extreme heat, as it makes their bones brittle.",
    "Bone Colossus: Necromancers, both living and dead, sometimes come together to make massive undead creatures known collectively as \u201cnecrotech\u201d. In nations ruled by undead, these massive creations often act as siege weapons or powerful modes of transportation._  \n**Bone Colossuses.** In a tome of deranged ramblings, the writer theorized how \u201cposthumes\u201d\u2014 the tiny skeletal creatures used to make up the bone collectives\u2014might be gathered in even greater numbers to form bigger, stronger creatures. Thus was born the Open Game License",
    "Bone Crab: _A bone crab\u2019s cracked skull scurries forward on bone-white legs. These tainted crustaceans make discarded craniums their home._  \n**Skull Shells.** Much like an enormous hermit crab, bone crabs inhabit the remains of large fish, humanoids, and other creatures. A bone crab\u2019s spiny, ivory-white legs blend in perfectly with bones and pale driftwood. When lacking bones, these crabs gnaw cavities into chunks of driftwood or coral to make a shelter, cementing bits of shell and debris to their portable homes. All crabs fight over choice skulls.  \n**Scavengers of Memory.** Bone crabs are voracious scavengers. They live in seaside crags and coves, where they use their specialized chelae to crack open skulls and feast on the brains. Centuries of such feeding have given bone crabs a collective intelligence. Some crabs retain fragments of memory from those they devour, and these crabs recognize friends or attack the foes of those whose skulls they wear.  \nBone crabs hunt in packs, preying on seabirds and creatures stranded in tidal pools. They drag aquatic prey above the high tide line and leave it to fester in the hot sun. They pick corpses clean in a few hours, so their hunting grounds are littered with cracked and sun-bleached bones\u2014the perfect hiding place for these littoral predators.  \n**White Ghost Shivers.** Because they eat carrion, bone crabs carry a dangerous disease\u2014white ghost shivers, which wrack victims with fever and delirium. Sailors and others who eat a bone crab\u2019s unwholesome, diseased flesh rarely survive it. Although bone crabs cannot be domesticated, they can be convinced to nest in particular areas, attacking intruders while ignoring the area\u2019s regulars.",
    "Bone Swarm: _Dank winds sweep up skeletons, both humanoid and animal. They blow forward, reaching out for living creatures like a clawed hand of bone. A scattering of bones rolls across the ground, then rises into the air, billowing like a sheet._  \n**Swarms of Fallen.** On rare occasions, the pugnacious spirits of fallen undead join together, bonded by a common craving: to feel alive again. They gather up their bones from life, as well as any other bones they come across, and form bone swarms.  \n**Nomadic Undead.** These swarms then ravage the countryside wresting life from living creatures, grabbing livestock, humanoids, and even dragons, digging in their claws in an attempt to cling to life. Bone swarms with one or more sets of jaws wail constantly in their sorrow, interrupting their cries with snippets of rational but scattered speech declaiming their woes and despair.  \n**Cliff and Pit Dwellers.** Bone swarms gather near cliffs, crevasses, and pits in the hope of forcing a victim or an entire herd of animals to fall to its death, creating more shattered bones to add to their mass.  \n**Undead Nature.** A mask wight doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Bonepowder Ghoul: _Distilled to nothing but dry, whispering sand and a full set of teeth, a bonepowder ghoul still hungers for flesh and blood. Its dusty mass is perfected corruption, entirely animated by foul energy._  \n**Starved Into Dust.** The bonepowder ghoul is small and unassuming, a pile of dust and bone fragments that resemble a pile of mummy dust or the remnants of a vampire burned by sunlight. Ghouls can achieve this powdery form through long starvation. The process invariably takes decades, which is why so few bonepowder ghouls exist\u2014few ghouls can show such self-restraint. Even among imperial ghouls, using hunger as a form of torture is considered offensive and is quite rare. A bonepowder ghoul may rise from the remnants of a starved prisoner or a ghoul trapped in a sealed-off cavern, leaving behind its remnant flesh and becoming animated almost purely by hunger, hatred, and the bitter wisdom of long centuries.  \n**Mocking and Hateful.** Bonepowder ghouls are creatures of pure evil, seeking to devour, corrupt, and destroy all living things. The only creatures they treat with some affinity are ghouls. Even in that case, their attitude is often mocking, hateful, or condescending. They have some mild respect for darakhul nobles.  \n**Whispering Voices.** Most bonepowder ghouls speak at least 4 languages, but their voices are very faint. Just to hear one speaking normally requires a DC 15 Perception check. Undead gain a +8 competence bonus to this check.",
    "Boneshard Wraith: A vaguely humanoid form appears, dim and hazy amid the constant swirl of wind-wracked grit and tainted dust of the magical wasteland._  \nContorted and broken, the boneshard wraith is a ghostly horror, haphazardly assembled from mismatched bones and grave-scavenged shards. Shattered eye sockets burn with the black, icy glow of eternal madness and the spiteful hunger of the Void.  \n**Undead Nature.** A boneshard wraith doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Bonespitter: A massive worm bursts through the ground, its body covered in bony protrusions._  \nBonespitters are bone-covered predators that live in the soft soil of grassy plains.  \n**Bones of Victims.** Bonespitters have unique digestive systems. When a bonespitter consumes another creature, the acid in the worm\u2019s stomach dissolves all of the prey\u2019s tissue and leaves only bones behind. The bones become part of the bonespitter\u2019s defenses, poking through its skin like sharp hair follicles. Other bones are stored in muscular sacks in the bonespitter\u2019s mouth, waiting to be unleashed on unsuspecting prey.",
    "Boomer: An ear-piercing shriek echoes in the cavern. The sound comes from a human-sized mushroom whose stalk steadily swells with air as it shrieks._  \n**Thunderous Shriek.** Boomers are a subspecies of Open Game License",
    "Boreal Dragon Wyrmling: Covered in a mix of hard, blue-white scales and patches of silvery-blue fur, this dragon radiates a savage belligerence. Its amber eyes gleam with primal fury as it stretches its wings, sending a shower of burning sparks sizzling onto the ground._  \n**Paradoxical Predators.** Boreal dragons inhabit the arctic and alpine places of the world, from snow-capped conifer forests and frigid mountain peaks to flat, icy plains and polar seas. Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.  \n**Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon\u2019s admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter. In particular, the dragons are fond of large arctic predators, such as Open Game License",
    "Boreas\u2019 Chosen: The humanoid\u2019s piercing blue eyes lock on their target as it charges forward with bloodlust. Bloodcurdling battle cries and flying spears follow the berserker\u2019s charge._  \nRegardless of what type of prior life they led, any humanoid can become one of Boreas\u2019 chosen. Some humanoids are born with runic symbols designating them as creatures blessed by the North Wind, but most must undergo several trials before the first wintry rune scrawls itself into their flesh. The trials include surviving the highest mountain peaks in the dead of winter, defeating a frost giant in single combat, and crafting a spear out of the fang or claw of an icy beast. Even then, Boreas may deny his favor.  \n**Blood and Weapons of Ice.** A humanoid chosen by Boreas goes through a transformation to become more like its patron. Its blood freezes into ice, and its weapons become forever rimed.  \n**Blessed and Loyal.** Humanoids chosen by Boreas further his goals, protect his holy sites, spread winter wherever they walk, and honor the North Wind with every fallen foe.",
    "Bouda: _A hulking, hyena-faced humanoid with heavily scarred, oversized muzzle, a bouda looks as if its jaw had once been ripped apart and put back together. Clouds of gnats and fleas roil around its arms._  \n**Glowing Eyes and Teeth.** Bouda are child-eaters, despoilers of purity and family. Resembling oversized gnolls, a web of scars along their muzzles is evidence of their gluttonous eating habits. Forever leering, their teeth glow as yellow as their eyes.  \n**Fly-Bedecked Shapechangers.** Bouda lurk on society\u2019s fringes, shapechanging to blend in with mortals. They seek out happy families, consuming the children in the night and leaving gruesome trophies behind. They may mark a victim nights before attacking to terrify the helpless parents.  \n**Gluttons.** Bouda have a weakness: they are incorrigible gluttons. When presented with a fresh corpse, even in combat, they will attempt to gorge on it or at least defile it for later consumption. Bouda are vindictive, seeking revenge on anything that drives them from a kill.",
    "Brachyura Shambler: The vaguely humanoid creature has an oblong head with a pair of deep-set black eyes, a pair of antennae, and grasping mandibles. The creature is covered in a chitinous shell that is deep red, almost black in color. As it moves, it makes a strange sound, as though it is asking unintelligible questions in gibberish._  \n**Purveyors of Mud.** Brachyura shamblers are foul, vaguely humanoid, semi-intelligent creatures that live in the mud and primarily eat carrion. They eat fresh kills when they can, but they find it easier to eat what is already dead. Because of their filthy living conditions and unsanitary diet, they carry disease, which they easily spread to those they encounter.  \n**Related to the Sporous Crab.** The brachyura often share living space with the Open Game License",
    "Brain Hood: A bear with the top of its head covered in a strange, slick, black substance looks around with purpose._  \n**Parasitic.** Brain hoods are parasites that are rarely encountered without host animals. In fact, outside of its host, a brain hood poses little danger to intelligent creatures or creatures who are not beasts. Brain hoods prefer to bond with larger creatures, such as bears or dire wolves, due to the beasts\u2019 impressive physical prowess. They use the animals as powerful physical vessels, helping the host creature find food but otherwise subjugating the dim intelligence within it.  \n**Calculating.** The brain hood is inherently evil and despises all living things that possess bodies of their own. They delight in using their beast forms to attack and kill humanoids, particularly if the humanoids are smaller or less powerful than their bonded beast.  \n**Druidic Enemies.** Given the unique nature of a brain hood\u2019s existence, some people mistake them for druids in beast form. Brain hoods often encourage this belief, sowing mistrust and discord between villagers and a local circle of druids. This practice, coupled with the brain hood\u2019s abominable treatment of beasts, drives druids to hunt down and destroy brain hoods. Traveling druids listen for stories of sudden, uncommonly aggressive animal attacks, knowing the cause could be a sign that a brain hood is in the area.",
    "Brimstone Locusthound: This creature is a disturbing combination of wolf and locust, and the smoke it exhales hovers thickly around it. Fur surrounds its locust head, and long, insectoid legs extend from its canine body._  \n**Unnatural Origin.** Brimstone locusthounds are the result of magical experimentation. Scholars are uncertain if the experiment went terribly wrong or if the creatures turned out as originally intended. The wizards who created them have been dead for thousands of years, allowing theories\u2014and the wizards\u2019 creations\u2014to run wild ever since.  \n**Migrating Packs.** Brimstone locusthounds build their nests below ground, in caves, or in buried ruins. They are migratory omnivores, and they prefer areas where fungi and small prey are plentiful. Though less caring for each other than most canines, brimstone locusthounds often form packs to rear young and when food is plentiful. However, when food becomes scarce, a pack of locusthounds tears itself apart, cannibalizing its weakest members, and the survivors scatter to the wind.",
    "Broodiken: _Tiny and built like a caricature of a person, this creature\u2019s enlarged head is filled with pointed teeth._  \n**Bodily Children.** Broodikens are crude servants created by humanoid spellcasters willing to grow them within their own bodies. They resemble their creators in the most obvious ways, with the same number of limbs and basic features, but all broodikens stand one foot tall with overly large heads and heavily fanged mouths. Those born to monstrous humanoids with wings or horns have ineffective, decorative versions that do not help the creature fly or fight.  \n**Emotional Echoes.** Broodikens have little personality of their own and respond to their creators\u2019 emotions, growling when their creators feel anger and babbling happily when their creators feel joy. When their creators are more than 100 feet away, they cry loudly with a sound that resembles children of the creator\u2019s own species. If discovered crying by anyone other than their creator, they attack. When their creators focus their anger on specific individuals, the broodikens attack as a group, using Stealth to get close and overwhelm single opponents.  \n**Born With Daggers.** Broodikens are created by eating the heart of a dead broodiken. Once this \u201cseed\u201d is consumed, 2d4 broodikens grow inside of the \u201cmother\u201d or creator. Nurturing the growing brood requires consuming specific muds, ashes, and plants, which cost 50 gp/day for each incubating broodiken. The incubation period requires one month and takes a toll on the creator\u2019s health. During this time, the creator becomes fatigued after four hours without eight hours\u2019 rest.  \nIf the creator is not a spellcaster, a spellcaster who meets the requirements below must supervise the incubation and birth. Most spellcasters birth the broodiken using a dagger before the broodiken tears its way out. A \u201cmother\u201d can only control one brood of broodiken at a time. Incubating a second brood makes the first brood furiously jealous, and it will turn on its own creator.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A broodiken doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

    "Bucca: _These tiny, obsidian-skinned, bat-winged fey always have a hungry look, leering with razor-sharp fangs showing and licking their leathery faces with their forked, purple tongues._  \n**Hidden in Crevices.** Buccas are tiny, underground faeries who are also known as \u201csnatchers,\u201d because they love to steal from miners and hoard precious minerals and gems in tiny, trap\u2011filled crevices. Their small size makes them easy to overlook.  \n**Treasure Finders.** Buccas are often enslaved by derro as treasure seekers and can be summoned by some derro shamans. Buccas are the bane of the dwarves of many mountains and hilly cantons, serving as spies and scouts for evil humanoids.  \n**Bat Friends.** Buccas often train bats as mounts, messengers, and guard animals. On occasion they sell them to goblins and kobolds.",
    "Bukavac: _Unleashing a bone-shattering roar, this toad-like monster bears two gnarled horns and wicked claws. It charges from its watery lair on six legs, eager for the kill._  \n**Pond Lurkers.** The placid surfaces of forest lakes and ponds hide many lethal threats, among them the bukavac. While not amphibious, the creature can hold its breath for minutes at a time as it lurks under the surface in wait for fresh meat.  \n**Enormous Roar.** A ravenous bukavac lives to hunt and devour prey, preferring intelligent prey to animals, and usually ambushes its victims. Due to its size, the beast must find deep ponds or lakes to hide in, but it can flatten itself comfortably to rest in two feet of water. It leads with its wicked horns before grabbing hold of its target or another nearby foe and hanging on as it claws its victim to death. The creature relishes the feel of its victim\u2019s struggles to escape its embrace and reserves its roar, which sounds like a cross between a toad\u2019s croak and lion\u2019s roar emanating from a creature the size of a dragon, for organized foes or against overwhelming numbers. If a bukavac\u2019s devastating sonic attack routs its foes, it picks off remaining stragglers; otherwise, it retreats to its underwater hiding spot.  \n**Clamorous Mating.** Solitary hunters by nature, bukavacs pair up briefly in the spring. Male bukavacs travel to a female\u2019s lair and demonstrate their prowess by unleashing their most powerful bellows. Villages ten miles away from the lair often hear these howls for a week and pray that the creatures don\u2019t attack. Once mating has been completed (and groves of trees have been destroyed), the female finds a secluded, shallow lake in which to bury eggs. A bukavac reaches maturity in five years, during which time it and its siblings hunt together. After the bukavacs mature, each finds its own lair.  \nA bukavac is 11 feet long, including its foot-long horns, stands four feet tall, and weighs 4,000 lb. The creature has a natural lifespan of 40 years, but its noise and proclivity to ambush intelligent prey attracts the attention of hunting parties, which considerably shorten its life expectancy.",
    "Bulbous Violet: An enormous deep purple flower pushes forward on its vines, which are covered in throbbing black protrusions. As it moves, a single protrusion bursts open, spraying a green, sizzling substance all over the forest floor._  \n**Meat Drinkers.** Bulbous violets are carnivorous plants. The black growths that cover their vines are filled with acid and pop on impact, dissolving the violets\u2019 prey. The plants then stand in the remains and drink in the liquefied gore.  \n**Migrating Predators.** Bulbous violets travel in packs that follow warm weather. Although they can survive the cold, most of their prey disappears in the colder months, forcing the plants to travel for food. Sometimes these paths take the plants through farms where the plants attack livestock and people. If the violets find food, they stop their migration, hunting every morsel they can find before moving on. Violets can sense the nearby presence of creatures made of flesh. This magical ability guides their migration route and leads them into unexpected places.  \n**Germinating in Gore.** In order to grow, bulbous violet seeds need to be sown in ground that has been covered in the blood, entrails, and corpses of other creatures. When a pack of violets is ready to drop their seeds, they go into areas crowded with prey and begin killing all they can. They attack monster hideouts, animal herds, and even villages to provide enough sustenance for their seeds.",
    "Bull: Bulky quadrupeds with vicious horns, bulls are territorial beasts known to charge creatures that they perceive as challenges.",
    "Buraq: _An aura of holiness surrounds this handsome human-headed equine with its short but strong feathered wings._  \n**Only the Worthy.** A buraq possesses astounding speed, determination, and resilience, among a host of noble qualities, but only pure-hearted humanoids can obtain a service from such a righteous and honorable creature.  \n**Angel Marked.** Every buraq wears a gilded band around its head or neck. These are said to be angelic seals or wardings, each different. The hide of every buraq is white, though their beards, lashes, manes, and tails vary from silver and dusty tan to deep brown or glossy black.  \n**Heavenly Steeds.** A buraq is smaller than a mule but bigger than a donkey, though their carrying capacity belies their size and apparent strength. Nevertheless, a buraq is the ultimate courier and a heavenly steed. Paladins and good-aligned clerics are the most likely candidates to ride a buraq, but other virtuous characters have had this privilege.",
    "Burrowling: _These light brown, furred creatures inquisitively survey their surroundings, each comforted by the presence of the others._  \n**Friendly Farmers.** Burrowlings work together at every task: digging tunnels, foraging, and rearing their young. They are omnivorous, eating roots, berries, insects, and reptiles\u2014and they consider snakes a particular delicacy. The most advanced burrowling towns set up rudimentary farms, where they grow the fruits and vegetables they usually find in the wild.  \n**Safe Warrens.** Some towns have domesticated prairie dogs, which burrowlings train to stand watch alongside their masters. Pairs of adults stand watch around the town perimeter and sound a warning when they spot a foe. An alerted town retreats to the safety of its warrens, while the strongest creatures add more tunnels if necessary, and close access from the surface until the threat has passed. In combat, burrowlings stand together in defense of the helpless young and fight with crude slings or their sharp teeth and claws.  \n**Die of Loneliness.** If separated from its coterie, a burrowling becomes despondent, crying for others of its kind. A lone burrowling usually dies of loneliness within a week, unless it can find its way back to its town or discover another burrowling town. Rarely, a solitary creature makes its way to a non-burrowling settlement where it attempts to assist its new community. This frustrates the creature and those it interacts with as it tries to anticipate what its companions want. It may join an adventuring party in the hope of returning to a settlement. After spending at least six months with a party, the burrowling can use its Burrow Tactics ability with its new allies.  \nBurrowlings live up to 15 years. Twice a year, a burrowling female bears a litter of up to three pups, but in especially dangerous regions, the creatures breed prodigiously to keep their population ahead of massive attrition. In cases like this, a female has a litter of five pups every other month. A burrowling pup reaches adulthood in a year.",
    "Butatsch: This horrific creature resembles an enormous, deflated cow\u2019s stomach, studded with thousands of glaring eyes awash with flame._  \n**The Horror in the Lake.** In certain deep, still lakes located in secluded valleys and mountain glens there lives the butatsch, a terrible monster from the subterranean reaches of the earth. It occasionally rises from the deep underwater caves in which it lives to slaughter and devour any creature that comes within its reach. The butatsch\u2019s amorphous body is easily as big as an elephant, and its countless eyes are frightening to behold. The butatsch burns or melts organic material before absorbing it and leaves nothing behind when it has finished eating.  \n**Unsettling Morality.** While the butatsch leaves a path of destruction wherever it goes, it is driven by a bizarre morality. It has been known to ignore and even protect weak or defenseless targets, such as farmers and cowherds, against other monsters and humanoids, slaughtering the weaker creatures\u2019 persecutors before vanishing back into the lake from which it came.",
    "Cackling Skeleton: The skeleton of a humanoid stands bent over with one arm holding the vacuous space where its stomach would be. Its jaw hangs agape, cackling, as it points at the target of its humor._  \n**Ironic Origins.** When a creature who utterly fears death perishes in an area filled with necrotic energy, it arises as a cackling skeleton. The creature\u2019s dead bones animate to mock the futility of their once-cherished desire of life. The cackling skeleton often wears garish items that parody what it loved in life.  \n**Nihilistic Hecklers.** Cackling skeletons find living creatures\u2019 survival instincts humorous. They find living incredibly futile and believe those that prolong their existence to be hilariously foolish. Unlike other skeletons, cackling skeletons are capable of speech, and they use it to point out the silliness of healing, wearing armor, or other means of self preservation, often pointing out the creature will inevitably die anyway.  \n**Undead Nature.** The cackling skeleton doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Cactid: _Rootlike tendrils explode from the sand at the base of this tall cactus bristling with needles. It uses its tendrils to reach for prey._  \n**Needled Sentients.** Cactids are semi-sentient cacti that grow in a myriad of shapes and sizes, from ground-hugging barrels and spheroid clumps that pin their victims to the ground to towering saguaros with clublike arms that yank victims off their feet. Most cactids are green or brown with distinct ribs; all are lined with countless needles.  \n**Drain Fluids.** In addition to gathering water, a cactid's tendril-roots can snag nearby creatures and pull them into a deadly embrace. Once a creature is pinned, the cactid\u2019s spines siphon off the victim\u2019s bodily fluids, until little but a dried husk remains. Many cactids are adorned with bright flowers or succulent fruit to lure prey into reach. Some scatter shiny objects within reach to attract sentient creatures. For those traveling the desert, however, a cactid\u2019s greatest treasure is the water stored within its flesh. A slain cactid\u2019s body yields four gallons of water with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. Failure indicates that only one gallon is recovered.  \n**Slow Packs.** Cactids were created by a nomadic sect of druids, but their original purpose is lost. They have limited mobility, so they often congregate in stands or to travel together in a pack to better hunting grounds.",
    "Cadaver Sprite: The ground seems to crawl with tiny skeletal humanoids. Red pinpricks of baleful light emanate from empty eye sockets. The creatures have bony wings and tiny, vicious-looking teeth._  \n**Punished Fey.** Cadaver sprites are the skeletal remains of sprites that have failed the fey courts. Some of them befriended non-fey and left the forest, others were simply too lazy to complete their duties, and many more were punished for dozens of other reasons. Whatever the case, the fey lords and ladies corrupt the bodies of the sprites so they can accomplish in death what they failed to do in life. As part of this corruption, the sprites\u2019 wings are reduced to bones, which removes their freedom to fly and forces them to stick to bushes and foliage. They typically band together and assault their opponents in large groups.  \n**Retain Elements of Individuality.** Unlike many forms of simple undead, cadaver sprites retain memories of their lives. These memories serve as a constant reminder of their failures. Those who associated with them in life consider them cursed or no longer recognize them. This inability to connect with those they once knew, combined with the compulsion to protect the forest and continue their previous duties, drives many cadaver sprites to madness.  \n**Deathspeakers.** For reasons known only to the sprites and the fey lords and ladies that created them, cadaver sprites are often found in areas occupied by Open Game License",
    "Caltrop Golem: A scattering of metal caltrops coalesces into a constantly shifting humanoid shape._  \nMade up of thousands of caltrops, a caltrop golem can assume nearly any shape it chooses, though it always remains an amalgamation of metal caltrops.  \n**Iterative Design** Caltrops golems were developed as a more advanced form of Open Game License",
    "Cambium: _Unfolding impossibly from beneath voluminous robes, this creature\u2019s pockmarked, spindly arms end in clusters of narrow spikes. Its long, hollow, needle-like fingers and its many-jointed arms move with surprising speed and strength for such an emaciated creature._  \n**Hunched and Robed.** The cambium skulks through mortal society, hunched and contorted, concealing its nine-foot height and its supernumerary arms.  \n**Devours Bodily Humors.** The source of a cambium\u2019s interest lies in every mortal body: the four humors, which it drains in precise amounts, sometimes to fix its own imbalances, sometimes to concoct serums meant for sale in hellish markets. Its victims are left in a desperate state, eager for a corrective fix and willing to obey the cambium\u2019s every whim as servants and toadies.  \n**Abandons Victims.** After a sufficient crop has been harvested, the cambium abandons these addicts to die slowly from violent withdrawals, and allows the local population to lie fallow for a decade or so.",
    "Carnivorous Ship: The prow of the ship opens into a gigantic, tooth-filled maw, while humanoid-shaped blobs of flesh swarm over the rails._  \n**Bribable.** A giant cousin to the mimic, the carnivorous ship is a cunning hunter of the seas. Wise captains traveling through known carnivorous ship hunting grounds carry tithes and offerings to placate the creatures.  \n**Solitary Ship Eaters.** Carnivorous ships live and hunt alone. Though they prefer to consume wood, metal, rope, and cloth, they aren\u2019t above eating flesh and readily eat entire ships, crew and all. They reproduce asexually after a season of particularly successful hunts. Young carnivorous ships are about the size of rowboats and use the statistics of a Open Game License",
    "Carnivorous Sod: What was a mere patch of green grass suddenly uproots itself and shows its true form: a flat, turtle-like creature with a wide maw filled with sharklike wooden teeth._  \n**Grassland Ambushers.** The carnivorous sod is a plant monster that disguises itself as a simple patch of grass until it is stepped on. It then uses its grass-like tendrils to trip a creature before biting with its vicious jaws. Carnivorous sods typically prey on small herbivores, such as deer and rabbits, that come to graze on their backs, but they have been known to attack just about anything that treads on them as long as the target is Medium or smaller. Sometimes dozens of carnivorous sods gather together to hunt, though this is due more to happenstance than planning on the part of the monsters.  \n**Links to the Fey.** Carnivorous sods begin their lives when a fey creature such as a pixie or Open Game License",
    "Carrier Mosquito: Carrier mosquitos are massive insects that defy logic, as they not only stay aloft but also zip around with incredible speed and maneuverability.

    "Carrion Beetle: _The beetles wore golden bridles and carried huge leather sacks of stone and guano. They marched without stopping; dozens, even hundreds, bringing fresh earth to the white-fungus trees of the great forests. Their claws skittered with a sound like horseshoes slipping on stone, but their multiple legs ensured they never fell. The air around them singed the nostrils with the taint of acid._  \n**Beasts of Burden and War.** Carrion beetles are powerful beasts of burden with strong jaws and the ability to both climb and burrow. With a wide back, serrated, spiky forelegs, and a narrow head, the carrion beetle is too large to ride on very comfortably although it makes an excellent platform for ballistae and howdahs. Its thick exoskeleton varies from drab brown, tan, and black to shimmering blue green, purple-green, and a highly prized yellow\u2011orange.  \nThe largest carrion beetles make a distinctive wheezing sound when their spiracles are stressed; this noise creates a hum when multiple beetles run or charge on the field of battle. War beetles are often armored with protective strips of metal or chitinous armor fused to their exoskeletons, increasing their natural armor by +2 while reducing their speed to 20 feet.  \n**Devour Fungi and Carrion.** Carrion beetles rarely gather in groups larger than a breeding pair and a small cluster of offspring in the wild. The domesticated varieties travel in herds of 20-40 to feed on fungal forests, scavenge battlefields, or devour cave lichen and scour sewage pits. The larger caravan beetles are always antagonistic.  \nWhen breeding season hits, carrion beetles feast on the bodies of large animals. They are often found in symbiotic relationships with deathcap mycolids, darakhul, and related species. Many species in the deep underworld consider carrion beetles food and use their exoskeletons to fashion shields and armor (though their chitin is too brittle for weaponry).  \nPurple worms are their major predators. Worms swallow entire caravans when they find the beetles within.  \n**Domesticated by Ghouls.** Domesticated by the darakhul, the carrion beetles live a more complex life. They begin as simple pack animals, with the strongest being trained as war beetles. War beetles often carry ballistae and harpoons fitted with lines for use against flying foes.  \nIn late life, the beetles are used as excavators, scouring out tunnels with their acid. After death, their exoskeletons are used both as animated scouting vehicles (ghouls hide within the shell to approach hostile territory) and as armored undead platforms packed with archers and spellcasters.",
    "Catscratch: The small cat emits a horrific yowl as its body begins to bulge and swell. Within moments, a massive, veined humanoid covered in patches of fur stands in the cat\u2019s place, casting a mad gaze._  \n**Not of This World.** A catscratch comes from parts unknown. No one is quite sure of its source, but wherever domestic cats are found, these creatures appear. It is a hybrid monster, created when an aberrant virus infects a cat or cat-like humanoid.  \n**Summoned by Rage.** An infected cat doesn\u2019t transform until it becomes angry, leaving many communities unaware of the disease until it is too late. Once a cat is sufficiently upset, it swells to a massive size, turning into a catscratch intent on destroying everything in sight.",
    "Cave Dragon Wyrmling: Covered in black spikes, the dragon\u2019s eyeless head swings from side to side. Darkness creeps from its strange, eel-like hide, spreading like ink in water.  \nApex predators of the underworld, cave dragons are the stuff of nightmare for creatures with little else to fear. They can speak, but they value silence, speaking rarely except when bargaining for food.  \n_**Born to Darkness.**_ Eyeless, these dragons have long, thin spikes that help them navigate tunnels, or seal passages around them, preventing foes from outflanking them. Their stunted wings are little more than feelers, useful in rushing down tunnels. Their narrow snouts poke into tight passages which their tongues scour free of bats and vermin. Young cave dragons and wyrmlings can fly, poorly, but older specimens lose the gift of flight entirely.  \nCave dragon coloration darkens with age, but it always provides good camouflage against stone: white like limestone, yellow, muddy brown, then black at adult and older categories. Mature adult and old cave dragons sometimes fade to gray again.  \n_**Ravenous Marauders.**_ Cave dragons are always hungry and ready to eat absolutely everything. They devour undead, plant creatures, or anything organic. When feeding, they treat all nearby creatures as both a threat and the next course. What alliances they do make only last so long as their allies make themselves scarce when the dragon feeds. They can be bribed with food as easily as with gold, but other attempts at diplomacy typically end in failure. Cave dragons do form alliances with derro or drow, joining them in battle against the darakhul, but there is always a price to be paid in flesh, bone, and marrow. Wise allies keep a cave dragon well fed.  \n_**A Hard Life.**_ Limited food underground makes truly ancient cave dragons almost unheard of. The eldest die of starvation after stripping their territory bare of prey. A few climb to the surface to feed, but their sensitivity to sunlight, earthbound movement, and lack of sight leave them at a terrible disadvantage.  \n\n## A Cave Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nLabyrinthine systems of tunnels, caverns, and chasms make up the world of cave dragons. They claim miles of cave networks as their own. Depending on the depth of their domain, some consider the surface world their territory as well, though they visit only to eliminate potential rivals.  \nLarge vertical chimneys, just big enough to contain the beasts, make preferred ambush sites for young cave dragons. Their ruff spikes hold them in position until prey passes beneath.  \nDue to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon\u2019s hoard may consist largely of food sources: colonies of bats, enormous beetles, carcasses in various states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn\u2019t immediately devour.  \nCave dragons are especially fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, sorted or arranged like artful ossuaries.  \nCave dragons have no permanent society. They gather occasionally to mate and to protect their eggs at certain spawning grounds. Large vertical chimneys are popular nesting sites. There, the oldest cave dragons also retreat to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action for one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.\n* A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom.\n* The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon. Creatures that are in the affected space or that enter it take 22 (4d10) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The swarm lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary cave dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Poisonous and odorless gases suddenly fill passages and caverns, and just as quickly disperse, within six miles of the dragon\u2019s lair.\n* Flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within six miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.\n* Swarms of vermin within one mile of the lair increase in both size and number as they try to escape the dragon\u2019s endless and undiscriminating hunger.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.",
    "Cave Drake: Widely-spaced, large eyes sit on either side of the dragon\u2019s broad, flat head, and sharp, curving teeth fill its fearsome maw. It clings to the ceiling, silently waiting for prey to appear below._  \nHighly adapted to hunting underground, this lesser cousin of true dragons stalks cavern passages for prey.  \n**Patient Predator.** An adult cave drake is between ten and fifteen feet long, with a thin, whip-like tail that nearly doubles its overall length. Its scales are dull and colored to match the surrounding stone. A cave drake hunts by lying in wait for prey to pass, often hanging from a wall or ceiling, before ambushing with its blinding venom. The drake then tracks the blinded creature as it flees, using a keen sense of smell and the creature\u2019s disorientation to follow it. A cave drake will follow prey patiently for miles, unless its quarry wanders into the territory of another cave drake.  \n**Solitary Hunter.** The cave drake is a lone predator. It typically lairs in high-roofed caverns, atop sheer ledges, or in other areas where it can take advantage of its superior climbing ability. Each cave drake claims a wide expanse of tunnels and caverns as its territory. A cave drake will fight to defend its territory from all other creatures, including other cave drakes, with the exception of mating season, when territories fluctuate as female drakes search for mates. A female cave drake will lay two to five eggs, raising the young until they are able to hunt on their own, then driving them out.  \n**Hoards.** Like their true dragon kin, cave drakes collect treasure, favoring shiny metals and sparkling gemstones. They will often arrange such treasures near phosphorescent fungi, glowing crystals, or other sources of light. Unlike true dragons, cave drakes are not overly protective or jealous of their hoards. The more cunning of their kind often use such objects as bait to draw out greedy prey while they wait in ambush.",
    "Cave Giant Shaman: This massive, bipedal creature has a slight hunch, making its long arms appear even longer. It wields a massive club etched with sigils. A pair of yellow tusks, adorned with rings of all materials, protrudes from its lower jaw._  \nCave giant shamans are gifted spellcasters who believe they are suited to consume spellcasting humanoids and absorb the humanoids\u2019 power. While the truth to this claim is dubious, there is no doubting their arcane prowess. They gravitate toward magic that allows them to change the composition of all materials, including air, flesh, and stone.  \n**Practical Leader.** Cave giant shamans are less superstitious than lesser Open Game License",
    "Cave Goat: Cave goats are the size of a spaniel and have dog-like paws rather than hooves. Despite being quadrupeds, they are accomplished climbers of the steep and uneven confines of the Underworld. Cave goats are loyal, if a bit surly, and strong, making them a favorite companion of Underworld travelers.",
    "Cavefish Zombie: This creature looks like a bloated, wet corpse. Its fingers and toes are webbed, and slick, fleshy fins run down its spine and legs, poking through stretches of dead flesh. An overpowering stench of rot surrounds it._  \n**Aquatic Adaptations.** The cavefish zombie is an unusual type of undead that occurs when dark magic permeates a lightless, watery environment, such as in an underground lake or the depths of the ocean. Rather than retain the bodily form it possessed in life, the creature\u2019s skin sloughs off from parts of its body as aquatic features burst through its flesh. Its fingers and toes become webbed, and fins form on its back and down its legs.  \n**Decay.** The cavefish zombie\u2019s dead tissue holds water, causing it to look bloated and loose and afflicting it with a persistent rot. This rot results in a horrific odor, which follows them whether they are in water or on land.  \n**Undead Nature.** A cavefish zombie doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Cavelight Moss: _These patches of tangled, lacy moss cling to the ceiling, slowly pulsing with an eerie glow. Their stems gently writhe among the soft, feathery mass, dusting the ground below with a twinkling of phosphorescent spores._  \n**Plant Carnivore.** Cavelight moss glows with a pale yellow light, but when agitated, its light changes to an icy blue. Cavelight moss is frequently mistaken for a benign organism, but it hunts living flesh and renders its meals immobile before starting the long process of digestion.  \nA cavelight moss is a collective of smaller life forms patched together and sharing sensations. Barely cognitive, a cavelight moss spends its time positioning itself above well-traveled sections of cavern, feeding on rats, bats, and crawling insects. When it senses larger prey, it slowly and quietly moves toward the creature.  \n**Long-Lived Spores.** A cavelight moss can survive for 200 years, shedding luminous spores and consuming vermin. Its spores germinate in the carcasses of its victims, and in lean times, these spores can grow, albeit slowly, on guano or other areas rich in moisture and organic nutrients.  \n**Rare Colonies.** If a cave system has no true protectors and food is plentiful, these creatures congregate\u2014most commonly, in bat colonies of millions of individuals. When they gather this way, cavelight mosses function as a large colony, covering strategic locations where prey roams. When a source of food moves on, the entire colony slowly disperses as well.",
    "Chameleon Hydra: A large chameleon pokes its head below the canopy. Soon, four other identical heads peek below the treetops. A massive body accompanies the heads, revealing they all belong to one creature. The creature\u2019s odd feet and long, curled tail transport it from tree to tree with ease, and its sticky tongues allow it to slurp up prey on the forest floor as it passes._  \nThe chameleon hydra thrives in thick, wooded areas where it makes nests in the canopies of large trees. It feasts on prey both above and below the canopy, using its sticky tongues to snatch unsuspecting prey.  \n**Apex Ambush Predators.** Chameleon hydras have scales that react to light and allow the hydras to blend in with their surroundings. They are extremely patient, waiting until the most opportune time to strike from a safe vantage point. Chameleon hydras primarily eat birds and giant insects, but they are known to dine on unwary travelers if other prey is scarce.  \n**Curious and Colorful.** Study of juvenile chameleon hydras shows they have inquisitive minds and that they alternate their scales in colorful patterns when near others of their kind. Scholars believe they use these color changes as a rudimentary form of communication.",
    "Chamrosh: This large sheepdog has luxuriant white-gold fur. A pair of broad wings stretches out from the creature\u2019s back, and its eyes are filled with an intelligent, silvery gleam._  \n**Celestial Guard Dogs.** Created from the souls of exceptionally faithful guards and retainers who selflessly sacrificed themselves to protect others, chamrosh are celestials that take the form of large sheepdogs with silver-gold fur and eagle-like wings. They are known for their ability to sniff out evil and for their steadfast nature, refusing to back down from a fight even in the face of overwhelming odds. Because of this quality, chamrosh are often used as guard beasts by other celestials, though they are never treated as simple pets by even the haughtiest of angels.  \n**Roaming Defenders.** When not employed by more powerful celestials as companions and guards, chamrosh gather in small packs to roam the planes of good, attacking any fiend or evil monster they come across. They also rescue lost or trapped mortals of good or neutral alignment, leading the mortals to a place of safety or to the nearest portal back to the Material Plane. Despite their appearance, chamrosh can speak and readily do so with mortals they rescue or celestials they serve or protect. .  \n**Occasional Planar Travelers.** Chamrosh rarely travel to the Material Plane, but when they do, it is usually for an important mission, such as to defend a holy relic or to aid a paladin on a divine quest. Since a chamrosh cannot change its form, such missions do not generally involve infiltration or deception, and when the task is finished, the chamrosh is quick to return to its normal duties.",
    "Chatterlome: When the oaken box is found on your stoop, run\u2014for the box devil is soon to come._  \nChatterlomes have featureless grey heads with large, round eyes, and their circular mouths are filled with needlelike teeth. They have misshapen torsos and short, bandy legs. Their most notable feature, though, is their four arms, which always wield woodworking tools.  \n**Vengeance Seekers.** Chatterlomes prey on scorned lovers, offering violent revenge for those who have been wronged. When a person calls upon the chatterlome, they soon receive an intricately carved oaken box with an obsidian inlay of a humanoid heart. Upon touching the box, the supplicant immediately knows that the box must be delivered to the home of the person who wronged the supplicant. When the victim opens the box, the chatterlome springs forth, claiming the heart of the victim and fulfilling the supplicant\u2019s request. Whether or not the box is opened, a chatterlome whose box has been delivered knows the location of the victim and tracks the person relentlessly. After the victim dies, the supplicant must then deliver the chatterlome\u2019s box to nine more victims or forfeit their own life. A string of deaths occurring shortly after victims received mysterious boxes is a sure sign that a chatterlome is in the area.  \n**Box Devils.** Chatterlomes are often called \u201cbox devils\u201d due to their peculiar ability to magically travel between boxes and other enclosed, wooden objects. Though chatterlomes can travel between boxes, each chatterlome has its original box, created when it was summoned by a supplicant who was scorned. If the chatterlome\u2019s original box is destroyed, the chatterlome returns to the Hells, where it waits for another scorned lover to call it back to the Material Plane.",
    "Chelicerae: _A chelicerae resembles a massive spider perched on tall, stilted legs. Most often, the disheveled body of a robed arcanist swings from its clenched mandibles._  \n**Feed on Spellcasters.** These massive arachnids are largely confined to the great forests and occasional wastelands, although rumors do persist of sightings in the dark alleys of magocratic cities, causing trepidation among the spellcasters there. Few creatures pose such a threat to spellcasters as chelicerae.  \n**Carry Their Prey.** Walking on high, stilted legs, these creatures resemble gigantic harvesters. More often than not, they are found with the grisly bodies of humanoids dangling from the chelicerae\u2019s clenched mandibles.  \n**Cocoon Arcanists.** Chelicerae stalk isolated victims, striking them with a poisonous bite and then pinning its prey within its jaws. There, their helpless body can hang for days on end as the chelicerae pursues obscure and eldritch tasks. At best, victims wake up weeks later with no memory of the events, far from home, and drained of vitality and spells. Others are stored immobilized in a thick cocoon in a high treetop until their body and mind recover. A few unlucky victims are slain and animated as walking dead to protect the chelicerae.",
    "Chernomoi: _These scaly creatures resemble nothing so much as tiny, batwinged dragonkin._  \n**Dragon Sprites.** Chernomoi (which means \u201clair sprite\u201d in Draconic) often reside discreetly in a dragon lair or dragonborn household, cleaning and tidying up at night, and only occasionally keeping a small trinket or shiny gemstone as compensation. They appear as tiny, winged dragonkin, dressed in metallic armor made of small coins and semi-precious stones.  \n**Lair Alarms.** Chernomoi are terrified of wyverns and never lair anywhere near them. Otherwise, they are very protective of their draconic masters and raise an alarm if an intruder is undetected. They fight with their tiny blades and Shriek attack if cornered, though they always flee from danger as a first option\u2014 usually straight to a dragon, dragonborn, or drake ally.",
    "Cherufe: A humanoid torso rises from a long, arthropod body made from overlapping plates of obsidian. The creature\u2019s face is twisted into a grimace of rage. Four arms ending in oversized fists jut from the torso. The creature\u2019s form radiates a red glow and a palpable heat as a fire rages within it._  \n**Corrupted Keepers.** The elemental anomaly that brings a Open Game License",
    "Child Of The Briar: _Its eyes gleam like polished walnuts, and its sly smile seems oddly placed on the tiny body, covered in spikes and thorns. The creature\u2019s waist is no thicker than a clenched fist, and its sinuous arms are no wider than a finger but twice the length of its body._  \n**Born of Magic.** Children of the briar are a frequent nuisance to fey and mortal alike. They grow in deep briar patches in forest clearings or along sunny hillsides and riverbanks. More rarely, they spawn when a sorcerer or magical creature\u2019s blood is spilled on the forest floor, or when summoned into being by obscure druidic items of power.  \n**Thorn Fortresses.** Despite their size, children of the briar gather in great numbers, cultivating ancient forest thickets into veritable fortresses. Wise men flee when they hear their clicking language in the underbrush, for the children have all the capricious wickedness of spiteful children and a taste for blood.  \n**Spies and Scouts.** From their lairs, the children of the briar creep far and wide to spy on the forest\u2019s inhabitants, sometimes using spiders, monstrous centipedes, and giant dragonflies as mounts. They converse with travelers bearing interesting news, but their words are thorned with gleeful malice, jealous bile, and lies. They are not above murder. They trade news and gossip for trinkets, favors, and drops of spilled blood.  \nThe fey have long used the children of the briar as spies and informants, and the power of the Otherworld now courses through their veins, allowing them to work simple magical tricks and slip between the mortal and faerie realms with relative ease.",
    "Chill Haunt: This ghostly humanoid\u2019s hands end in frozen claws. Water drips from the claws, freezing before it hits the ground._  \n**Forlorn Spirits.** Chill haunts arise from the corpses of humanoids that froze to death. While most chill haunts derive from those who died alone in the cold, stories tell of entire families or villages returning as chill haunts. Because of the intensity of their demise, chill haunts dread cold and flee when targeted by cold magic.  \n**Hungry for Body Heat.** The chill haunt\u2019s disdain for cold leads it to seek out warm buildings or open fires. While ambient heat or direct contact with fire diminishes its shivering and restores wounds it has received in combat, it craves heat from living creatures. Contact with the chill haunt sets off a deepening freeze in the victim, which is hard to reverse without the application of fire. The haunt comes into contact with living creatures to remember the feeling of warmth, and it does not care about the side effects of its touch. After it has drained the warmth from one creature, it immediately moves on to the next, ever-hungry.  \n**Restless Undead.** Destroying a chill haunt is only a temporary solution to the undead creature\u2019s depredations. Similar to a ghost, a destroyed chill haunt returns to unlife 24 hours after its demise, attaining eternal rest only after being slain under a specific set of circumstances. For most chill haunts, the surest way to eternal rest is by coaxing the haunt to a warm building where it can sit by a hearth and nestle in blankets or furs. Though physical objects normally pass through the spectral creature, such conditions allow the coverings to conform to the shape of the haunt\u2019s former body. Moments later, the haunt lets out a contented sigh and winks out of existence.  \n**Undead Nature.** A chill haunt doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Chimeric Phantom: The vague outline of a tortured being flickers, appearing as though it may have once been human. Its face is composed of many faces, and its expressions shift rapidly from madness to anger to pain. Its features change from one moment to the next, resembling one person for a short time, then someone else, or an odd combination of several at the same time._  \n**Recombined Spirits.** Chimeric phantoms are created when intelligent creatures, most often humanoid, are consumed by a Open Game License",
    "Chort Devil: _Small horns crown this pig-faced devil\u2019s head. It stands on shaggy goat legs and holds a flaming polearm in its clawed hands. It bears a wicked gleam in its black eyes._  \n**Bad Bargains.** Quick and canny, a chort devil uses varied, pleasing forms to entice mortals to make terrible bargains, but it revels in its obvious devilishness. A chort wants its victim to know it is dealing with a devil. The relative straightforwardness of this approach enables the creature to better deceive those whom it bargains with. After all, the chort affirms, if the victim weren\u2019t so desperate, he wouldn\u2019t be bargaining with a devil. If necessary, an implied threat of immolation gives it greater bargaining power, but the creature is careful not to torture or otherwise harm its patsy, since that voids any potential contract.  \n**Recitation of Contracts.** An annual spectacle in large cities involves some poor fool who believes he can trick a chort and escape a legal bargain. The devil appears and recites the entirety of the contract its victim signed, replete with embarrassing details about a dispatched rival, the ensnarement of a love who once spurned him, and other disclosures. A chort ensures all those entangled in its victim\u2019s affairs are present to hear it, and it disappears once all the victim's dark secrets have been revealed.  \n**Smear Tactics.** A zealous opponent of the chort often finds himself the victim of his own hubris, as the devil digs up or creates vile tales about its foe and brings his folly to light. A chort enjoys tarnishing the reputation of tools of good. For example, it may steal a paladin\u2019s sword and use it to murder an especially pious person, leaving the sword in the victim. Thus, a chort dispatches a foe strongly resistant to its manipulations, brings suspicion to another potential foe, and taints a weapon\u2014at least in reputation\u2014which might be used against it.",
    "Chronalmental: _A chronalmental is difficult to pin down, and it may appear as a large man-shaped absence in the air that reveals first a field of stars, then a contorted rainbow of colored bands, then a brilliant white light, strobing in and out of existence._  \n**Fluid as Time.** Shifting between the past, present, and future, chronalmentals are formed from temporal energy. They flow like sand in an hourglass and exist between the tickings of a clock.  \nThe first chronalmentals were forged from extra time left over from the beginning of the universe. Many served as shock troopers in unfathomable wars between angels and fiends or gods and ancient titans. Most were lost between seconds or abandoned to drift aimlessly in the Astral Plane or in the void between the stars.  \n**Stewards of Calamity.** Locations of historical significance\u2014 both past and future\u2014attract chronalmentals. They have a fondness for battlefields and other sites of strife. Because they are drawn to noteworthy places, chronalmentals have a reputation as harbingers of calamity, and their presence may incite panic among scholars, priests, and sages.  \n**Environmental Chaos.** Whatever the terrain, the environment behaves strangely around the chronalmental. Collapsed walls might suddenly rise, seedlings become massive trees, and fallen soldiers relive their dying moments. These changes occur randomly, a side-effect of a chronalmental\u2019s presence, and things return to normal when they depart.  \n**Elemental Nature.** A chronalmental does not require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Chronomatic Enhancer: A giant clock walks on four insectoid legs. As a bolt of fire flies at a nearby humanoid, the clock creature\u2019s inner gears spin and the fire fizzles into a singe on the humanoid\u2019s cloak._  \nChronomatic enhancers are constructs made by powerful spellcasters specializing in time-altering magic. Enhancers are protective guardians of their masters and powerful tools the spellcasters can utilize.  \n**Time Construct.** A chronomatic enhancer resembles a large clock with its inner workings clearly visible. It has four beetle-like legs and two arms. Intricate rune-like markings and glowing blue gems sparkle throughout the enhancer\u2019s interior. These magical runes allow the chronomatic enhancer to alter time around it in minor ways, aiding allies and hindering foes.  \n**Construct Nature.** The chronomatic enhancer doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Cikavak: _The cikavak is a remarkably ugly magical bird\u2014a supernatural creature conjured through a lengthy ritual. A dark gray comb flops atop their heads and shapeless wattles dangle from their throats. They seem unimposing._  \n**Dagger Beaks.** Cikavaks use their elongated, dull-gray beaks to draw up nectar and other fluids\u2014or to stab with the force of a dagger. Although it requires great effort to call up these homely birds, the magic is surprisingly common, known among peasants and townsfolk as well as mages. Once summoned, they remain faithful to their masters until death. While cikavaks don\u2019t speak, they comprehend the Common tongue and can speak with animals to help their master. They often magically silence the cries of more melodious birds.  \n**Potion Pouches.** Cikavaks possess another odd ability: when fully distended, their ventral pouches hold up to half a gallon of almost any liquid. These resilient pouches take little or no damage from their contents, holding potions without ingesting them or even carrying acid without injury.  \nThieves make use of this ability, directing the birds to siphon up liquids and thus steal honey from neighbors\u2019 beehives, as well as milk, beer, and wine. The most audacious thieves send their birds into magicians\u2019 towers, alchemists\u2019 shops, or the local apothecary to seize mercury, phlogiston, and more exotic substances. They carry these stolen fluids back to their owner in their pouches. While normally strong flyers, when laden with liquids, their flight is clumsy at best.  \n**Folk Conjuration.** To call a cikavak with folk magic rituals, a character must gather an egg from a black hen as well as 30 gp worth of herbs and colored chalks. Cast at sunset, the folk ritual requires half an hour and requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to succeed. (The material components can be used multiple times, until the ritual succeeds). The hen\u2019s egg must then be carried and kept warm for 40 days. During this time, the ritual caster must not bathe or be subject to any spell effects. Usable only by non-casters, the ritual\u2019s feeble magic is immediately dispelled if the cikavak\u2019s master uses any other sort of spell or spell-like ability.",
    "Clockwork Abomination: _At rest, a clockwork abomination resembles a pile of debris and scrap on the ground, but in motion it reveals a large insectoid form with smoke rising between the plates of its hide. Its many orange\u2011yellow eyes shine like dim lanterns and reveal no hint of expression or intent._  \n**Bound Devils.** Clockwork abominations result from ill\u2011considered attempts to bind lesser devils into clockwork or steam-driven constructs. The disciplines of devil binding and engineering seemingly do not mix well, and the results of such attempts are typically disastrous. Every now and then, however, something goes right, and a clockwork abomination is created.  \n**Junk Collectors.** Clockwork abominations are canny enough to collect bits of old wagons, tools, or machinery as camouflage. Motionless among such objects, they can often surprise a foe.  \n**Sadistic Machines.** Malevolent in the extreme, these fiendish automatons are frustrated by the limits of their new forms, and they delight in inflicting suffering on others. Constantly seeking to break free of their creators\u2019 control, the most they can be entrusted to do is to serve as a guardian or attack something.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork abomination doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Clockwork Archon: The air around this massive construct is filled with the sound of spinning gears and mechanisms. It spreads its metal wings and takes to the air in a roar of wind._  \n**Servants of the Righteous.** Clockwork archons are built to fight in the names of deities devoted to justice, battle, and glory. They stand as bulwarks upon the battlefields of the holy, offering a rallying point for paladins and crusaders. Churches that have the ability to manufacture clockwork archons guard the knowledge jealously, lest it fall into the hands of the unworthy.  \n**Engines of War.** Clockwork archons are deployed as support vehicles and weapons. A single archon can quickly reduce a small settlement\u2019s defenses to ruin, while groups of them can swiftly render fortified structures to rubble. Armies with clockwork archons at their disposal sometimes use them to move sensitive material and personnel into position.  \n**Corruptible Constructs.** On occasion, a clockwork archon is captured by the enemy. The followers of some evil gods, archdevils, and demon lords have determined methods of overwriting the construct\u2019s animating magic, turning the creature to their fell purposes. More than one community has had its cheer turn to dismay as the clockwork archon they freely allowed inside the walls disgorged enemy agents while attacking the structures and residents. More insidious cults use their clockwork archons to mask their true natures. They allow the common folk to believe they represent good faiths while they rot the community\u2019s moral fabric from the inside.  \n**Construct Nature.** A clockwork archon doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Clockwork Beetle: _Gleaming metal and whirring gears make up the form of this elaborate mechanical insect the size of a housecat._  \n**Bejeweled Familiars.** Forged by talented jewelers and sold to gear-mages and aristocrats, clockwork beetles are highly prized as familiars. Although normally created in the form of metal beetles, their appearance can vary greatly. Some resemble incandescent ladybugs while others have razorsharp horns reminiscent of deadly stag beetles. Some are fashioned as darkling beetles with prehensile antennae, and even weevil-like designs have been spotted.  \n**Flying Noisemakers.** In the southern deserts, scarab beetle patterns are particularly prized. Anytime the creatures move they emit an audible rhythmic buzz, especially when taking to the air. Once in flight, they create a disturbing cacophony of clicks and whirs.  \n**Hidden Timers.** The most talented gear\u2011mages occasionally design a clockwork beetle with a hidden countdown clock that silently ticks down over years or even decades. When the tightly wound gear-counter expires, it suddenly triggers a mechanical metamorphosis within the beetle, causing it to rapidly transform and blossom into a completely different clockwork creature\u2014a wondrous surprise known in advance only to the designer who created it so many years ago.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork beetle doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Clockwork Beetle Swarm: _Light glints off the moving parts of almost a thousand clockwork beetles in a biting cloud._  \n**Freed But Foolish.** Clockwork beetle swarms form when several of the creatures break free of their creators and bond together in a noisy mass of clattering mechanical parts. Severed from the bond of their creators, the beetle swarm lacks the telepathy of singular clockwork beetles and has a reduced mental capacity.",
    "Clockwork Hound: _This black, mechanical hunting dog keeps its nose to the ground sniffing and whuffling. Gleaming teeth fill its metal mouth._  \n**Ticking Bloodhounds.** Partners to the clockwork huntsmen, these black hounds follow the trails of criminals, escaped slaves, and other unfortunates. Their infused spirits are those of hunting hounds, and their animating magic allows them to follow a scent with preternatural speed and accuracy.  \n**Toy Variants.** Some claim the infusion of animal spirits into clockwork hounds was one of the great arcane discoveries that made the creation of the gearforged possible; others say that it has done nothing but make clockwork mages rich. Certainly the earliest hounds were built for work and war, but the most recent varieties also include some that are deceptively big-eyed and painted as children\u2019s toys or to match a young aristocrat\u2019s favorite outfit.  \n**Serve the Rulers.** Despite this brief flirtation with fashion, most clockwork hounds continue to serve town watches, royal huntsmen, road wardens, moneylenders, and criminal gangs as loyal trackers and guards.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork hound doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Clockwork Huntsman: _A clockwork huntsman is mechanical soldier clad in flat-black armor, and beneath its breastplate, gears tick and whir._  \n**Slave Hunters.** These metal huntsmen were once the province of corrupt aristocrats, running down escaped slaves and tracking prey in hunting expeditions. Their masters may vary, but the clockwork huntsmen still perform when called upon. In some places they operate only on the command of the secret police, hunting down persons of interest wanted for questioning.  \nHuntsmen may operate alone, but usually they seek their quarry as a small group of two or three. Because they are unsleeping and tireless, few can hide from them for long without magical assistance.  \n**Despised Machines.** Clockwork huntsmen are painted matte black with mithral trim, and occasionally outfitted with armor or a black steel blade for added intimidation. Common folk detest them; all but their keepers and commanders shun them.  \n**Obedient to Orders.** Bound with specific instructions, clockwork huntsmen patrol, stand sentry, or remain unmoving as ordered, always paying attention, always alert to their surroundings. Clockwork huntsmen are unrelenting and single-minded in their missions, focusing on particular targets\u2014priests, spellcasters, or heavily armored intruders, as directed. Oblivious to injury, clockwork huntsmen attack until destroyed or ordered to stand down.  \nClockwork huntsmen stand nearly six feet tall and weigh 400 lb.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork huntsman doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Clockwork Leech: From a distance this creature appears to be an enormous leech. Closer observation reveals it to be a clockwork device. Blood stains its maw, which leaks a green fluid with a vaguely astringent odor._  \n**Collectors of Blood.** Hags and other magic practitioners who require blood for their rituals and sacrifices create clockwork leeches to scout marshlands and neighboring settlements for large groups of living creatures. The leeches are designed to extract their fill and return to their controllers, who access and drain their reservoirs. Autonomous clockwork leeches continue to collect blood, but, without masters to whom they deliver it, they go through cycles of draining blood then violently disgorging it. Regardless of their purpose (or lack thereof) for obtaining blood, most clockwork leeches retreat after getting their fill.  \n**Waterproof Swimmer.** A clockwork leech has layered copper plating that keeps water away from its inner mechanisms. These mechanisms allow the leech to propel itself through water. They can use this propelling undulation on land to make attacks with their \u201ctails.\u201d Leeches that don\u2019t receive regular cleanings eventually turn green as the copper corrodes.  \n**Unseen, Unheard, and Unfelt.** The same plating that protects the clockwork leech\u2019s inner mechanisms also buffers noise from the gears. Its coloration allows it to blend in with marshland foliage and silty water. Finally, when it punctures a creature\u2019s skin, it releases a sedative to numb the wound, leaving the victim unaware of the injury and subsequent blood drain. The leech doesn\u2019t have an unlimited supply of the sedative, and a leech that hasn\u2019t undergone maintenance for a few weeks loses its Anesthetizing Bite trait. Because the leech must remain attached to its victim to drain its blood, it prefers to attack lone or sleeping targets.  \n**Construct Nature.** A clockwork leech doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Clockwork Mantis: This large clockwork mantis is surprisingly nimble and fast, capable of taking down foes with a lethal flurry of serrated claws and bites._  \n**Wanted by Gnomes.** The existence of these wandering clockwork monsters creates a bad reputation for peaceful gnomish engineers. A few groups of gnomes specialize in tracking and destroying these clockwork creations. They claim to do it out of virtue, but rumors abound that they do it for rare parts.  \n**Construct Nature.** The clockwork mantis doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink or sleep.",
    "Clockwork Myrmidon: _This hulking brass and iron creature resembles a giant suit of plate armor; a constant growl issues from its midsection. It stands 9 feet tall and its squat head wears an angry expression. A clockwork myrmidon always moves with moves with a powerful, determined grace unusual in most clockwork creations._  \n_**Elite Machines.**_ Clockwork myrmidons are heavily armored at their joints and at most vital parts. They are much too valuable to undertake patrols or menial labor, and they are unleashed only for dangerous situations that clockwork watchmen cannot handle.  \n_**Single Targets.**_ A clockwork myrmidon defends itself but does not initiate combat unless so directed by its master. When it does enter battle, a clockwork myrmidon is unrelenting and single-minded, and it attacks one particular target until that foe surrenders, escapes, or is defeated.  \nUnless given other instructions, a clockwork myrmidon attacks whatever enemy is closest to it. A clockwork myrmidon attacks until destroyed or ordered to stand down.  \n_**Alchemical Tricks.**_ A clockwork myrmidon is always outfitted with alchemical fire, acids, grease, and other special devices. An alchemist is required to keep one running well.  \n_**Constructed Nature.**_ A clockwork myrmidon doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Clockwork Tiger: The ticking of metal gears is all that hints at the presence of a pair of feline-shaped metal creatures. They are bronze and steel, with sharp metal teeth and razor claws._  \n**Magical Origin.** Clockwork tigers were invented as guardians in times now long forgotten. In spite of their age, they continue to serve their original purpose as guardians, protecting ancient ruins and new masters alike. The number of clockwork tigers in existence is slowly rising, leading many scholars to speculate on the reason. Some suspect the instructions for creating them were finally found, while others surmise a natural phenomenon unearthed a lost vault of clockwork tigers.  \n**Found in Pairs.** Clockwork tigers are almost always found in pairs and almost always guarding a spellcaster or magical object, which they consider their \u201cward.\u201d The tigers work in tandem to defeat threats and protect their wards, leaping in and out of combat. Their clockwork brains are capable of thought, but they are less interested in communication and wholly devoted to protecting their wards.  \n**Construct Nature.** A clockwork tiger doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Clockwork Watchman: _This mechanical being\u2019s body is composed of brass and iron and bedecked in a loose uniform of the city watch. Its movements are slow but steady._  \n**Lightly Armored Servants.** Clockwork watchmen are more solidly built versions of the more common clockwork scullions (servant creatures in wealthy households, incapable of combat). Proper clockwork watchmen are built with iron parts instead of tin, and given keener senses. Many have small bits of armor covering their joints and most vital parts.  \n**Constant Rounds.** They endlessly patrol the city day and night, pausing only to receive maintenance and new boots.  \n**Shouts & Stutters.** Their speech is slow and halting, but their distinctive shouts and whistles bring human guards at a run.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork watchman doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Clurichaun: _Around a corner in the wine cellar stumbles a surly, two-foot tall man carrying an open bottle of wine. He has a bushy beard and wears a rumpled, red overcoat over a dirty white shirt and kneelength red trousers with blue stockings and silver-buckled shoes. A cap made from leaves stitched together with gold thread slouches atop his head, and he reeks of stale beer and wine._  \n**Drunks in the Cellar.** Clurichauns are mean-spirited, alcohol-loving fey that plague butteries and wine cellars. These drunken fey were once leprechauns, but they long ago forsook a life of toil for one of solitary debauchery. Now they spend every night drinking, warbling off-key, and tormenting their hapless hosts with cruel pranks.  \nHowever, if the clurichaun\u2019s host keeps him or her well supplied with a favorite libation and otherwise leaves him or her alone, the clurichaun will protect their wine cellars from thieves, drunkards, or worse\u2014becoming quite vigorous when they feel the security of the cellars is threatened in any way. They have a particular hatred for Open Game License",
    "Cobbleswarm: _The paving stones underfoot suddenly lurch and tumble over one another. Thousands of tiny limbs, pincers, and stingers break from the stony surface and frantically scuttle forward._  \nA cobbleswarm is made up of tiny, crablike creatures with smooth, stony shells. Individually they are referred to as cobbles. The creatures vary in size, shape, and color, but all have six segmented legs, a whiplike stinger, and a single eye.  \n**Paving Stone Mimics.** When the eye is closed and the limbs are pulled under the shell, cobbles are nearly indistinguishable from lifeless paving stones. Victims of cobbleswarms are caught unaware when the floor beneath them suddenly writhes and shifts, and dozens of eyes appear where there should be none.  \n**Trap Affinity.** Cobbleswarms have a rudimentary understanding of traps. They often hide in places where their shift and tumble ability can slide intruders into pits or across trapped areas, and kobold tribes prize them highly for this reason.",
    "Coll\u00e1is: The coll\u00e1is is a large, deer-like creature covered in thick, black fur. A great rack of antlers grows from its thick skull, in which prominent eye sockets display two red embers for eyes. The monster has no mouth; instead, a coarse beard grows in its place._  \n**Summoned Protector.** If a forest village is in danger, the villagers might perform a ritual sacrifice to summon a coll\u00e1is. Once the ritual is complete, the creature appears in the branches of a nearby tree. It then stalks the village and its surroundings. A coll\u00e1is returns to its home plane after 24 hours.",
    "Commoner: **Commoners** include peasants, serfs, slaves, servants, pilgrims, merchants, artisans, and hermits.",
    "Compsognathus: The curious bipedal lizard lets out a musical chirp. More chirps respond from within the nearby grass, becoming a sinister chorus._  \nOpen Game License",
    "Conjoined Queen: The torso of a pale humanoid woman melds into the thorax of a massive insect. It moves about on six pointed legs, stabbing through stone and metal alike._  \n**Born in Chaos.** The first conjoined queen was created when cultists sacrificed a captured queen to their dark insectoid god. In a ritual of chaotic magic, the human queen and an insect queen were joined, forming a chitinous chrysalis from which the conjoined queen eventually emerged.  \n**Rulers of the Many-Legged.** A conjoined queen rules from a subterranean throne room, often in a burrow under the ruins of a fallen monarchy\u2019s castle. There she commands her insectoid host and sits atop a pile of incubating eggs.  \n**Hungry for Power.** The conjoined queen hungers for humanoid flesh but also for power. She seeks to rule and conquer humanoids and insects alike. Her armies consist of giant insects and the humanoids who ride them into battle.",
    "Coral Drake: _Swimming upright, this creature peels itself from the vibrant seascape and strikes with needle-thin claws, shredding teeth, and a wickedly curved stinger._  \n**Camouflaged Hunter.** Like a piece of moving coral, this drake\u2019s coloration and scale patterns change to match nearby anemones, corals, seaweed, and sea urchins. This adaptation allows the creature considerable stealth in its natural habitat. It avoids combat if it can, preferring to hide and protect its young. Long serrated spines stretch from the coral drake\u2019s body, waving in brilliant colors against a blue sea.  \n**All Spikes and Needles.** The creature\u2019s long snout stretches out from its narrow face and an array of spikes and slender protrusions form a jagged crown. Inside the mouth, serrated teeth form multiple ringed ridges where it\u2019s young feed on leftover scraps of food and small parasites. Needle-thin talons spring from finned appendages, and a stinger frilled with tiny barbs curves at the end of its slender tail.  \nA coral drake measures seven feet from the tip of its snout to its barbed stinging tail. Thin and agile, the beast weighs less than 100 lb. Both male and female coral drakes gestate their delicate eggs inside sacks within their mouths and throats. This oral incubation protects the vulnerable eggs, but only a handful ever reach maturity, because their parents use the ravenous spawn for defense.  \n**Poisonous Lairs.** Coral drakes live in warm waters near great coral reefs. They hollow out small lairs and protect their meager hoards with the aid of the area\u2019s natural inhabitants. Because they are immune to poison, coral drakes often choose lairs nestled in forests of poisonous sea urchins, stinging anemones, and toxic corals.  \nAside from humankind, the coral drake harbors a great rivalry with dragon turtles. These beasts prize the same hunting grounds and nests and fight for supremacy in the richest reefs.",
    "Corpse Mound: _The reeking pile of bodies and bones as large as a giant lurches forward. Corpses that tumble off it rise moments later as undead and follow the determined hill of corruption._  \n**Rise from Mass Graves.** In times of plague and war, hundreds of bodies are dumped into mass graves. Without sanctifying rites, necromantic magic can seep into the mound of bodies and animate them as a massive horror hungering for others to join its form.  \n**Absorb Bodies.** A corpse mound is driven to kill by the anger and loneliness of the dead within, and to absorb the bodies of its victims. It attacks any living creature larger than a dog, but it is drawn to humans and humanoids. It never tires no matter how many victims it accumulates. Entire towns have been wiped out by advancing corpse mounds.  \n**Undead Nature.** A corpse mound doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Corpse Worm: A large, bloated worm, its body the gray-white pallor of death and slicked with yellow mucus, crawls across a pile of corpses. As its dozens of legs propel it over the bodies, its fang-filled maw opens to reveal a second jaw that repeatedly bursts outward, slurping up chunks of flesh with each strike._  \nThese creatures prowl deep caverns, seeking flesh to devour.  \n**Eaters of the Dead.** The corpse worm feeds primarily on death and decay, though it hunts and kills living prey it encounters if hungry. Corpse worms have a keen sense of smell that they can use to locate wounded prey or sources of carrion on which to feed.  \n**Ignore the Unliving.** While both the living and the dead are food for the corpse worm, it doesn\u2019t feed upon the undead. Unless attacked, the corpse worm ignores undead near it. Some intelligent undead tame and train corpse worms, using them as pets, guardians, or shock troops.  \n**Slimy Eggs.** A female corpse worm lays up to two dozen eggs in crevasses, cul-de-sacs, or other remote areas. Corpse worm eggs are about the size of a human head and are sheathed in a rubbery, translucent gray membrane. The eggs are deposited with a sticky, mustard-colored excretion, allowing them to be placed on walls or even ceilings. This excretion exudes a powerful smell that many subterranean predators find unpleasant, and it allows the mother to relocate the eggs as she watches over them until they hatch.",
    "Corrupted Pixie: A wrinkly, purple-skinned pixie with small black horns and bat wings flits about, chanting a violent song about harvesting organs._  \nCorrupted pixies are fey turned fiends who savor violence.  \n**Corrupted by Hags.** Hags sometimes capture pixies and torture them by forcing the tiny fey beings to watch the hags commit acts of depraved violence. These acts combined with the hags\u2019 magic drive the pixies mad, twisting their forms and turning them into corrupt versions of what they once were. The corrupted pixies become fiends that live to serve the hags who created them. Many of these pixies think of their creators as gods who exposed the world\u2019s true joys: murder, torture, and other evil acts.  \n**Mischief Makers.** Hags send corrupted pixies to cause mischief and chaos to punish their enemies, for their own entertainment, or as a distraction from the hags\u2019 more sinister schemes. The pixies delight in these tasks, often using their magic to make people harm one another and remaining invisible as long as they can. Corrupted pixies like to make the pain last as long as possible before their tricks satisfyingly result in another creature\u2019s death.  \n**Destroy Beauty.** Corrupted pixies take a special joy in destroying anything beautiful, be it a work of art, a garden, or the face of a handsome adventurer. The fiends sometimes become distracted from their hag-assigned tasks because the opportunity to mar something perfect is too good to pass up.  \n**Restored by Pixie Dust.** If a corrupted pixie is captured, it can be restored to its fey form. The captured pixie must be showered with pixie dust every day at sunrise for ten consecutive days. On the final day, the pixie reverts to its original form.",
    "Corrupting Ooze: _A corrupting ooze boils and bubbles with rank marsh gas and the fetid stench of the sewer, and it leaves a stinking trail of acidic slime wherever it goes._  \n**Swim and Walk.** A corrupting ooze is a festering slime that can slither and even swim like a gigantic sea slug, or it can assume a roughly humanoid form and shamble through the streets, though its stench and its lack of speech make it unlikely that anyone might mistake it for a normal person. They are frequently soldiers and servants to heralds of blood and darkness.  \n**Dissolve Bones.** A corrupting ooze can absorb an entire large animal or small person, simply dissolving everything including the bones in a matter of minutes. This function makes them an important element of certain dark rituals.",
    "Crimson Drake: _Crimson drakes are easy to spot, with scales the color of dried blood, a deadly scorpion stinger, and a mischievous gleam in their eyes._  \n**Fiery Raiders.** Crimson drakes lair in woodlands near small settlements, making nighttime forays to set fires and hunt those who flee the flames\u2014traits that make humanoid tribes prize them as raiding partners. Goblins gleefully adopt a crimson drake as a mascot to burn things down while they get on with slaughtering people. Red dragons and flame dragons regard a crimson drake as a pet, at best, but this rarely works out. When it is inevitably insulted by its larger cousins, a malicious crimson drake may even intentionally set fires to blaze a trail for hunters to the dragon\u2019s lair.  \n**Mistaken for Pseudodragons.** A crimson drake\u2019s scales and features are quite similar to those of a pseudodragon, and they will imitate a pseudodragon\u2019s hunting cry or song to trick victims into approaching. Once their prey gets close enough, they immolate it.  \nAs with pseudodragons, they resemble a red dragon in all but size and the presence of the drake\u2019s scorpion-like stinger. On average, a crimson drake weighs 12 lb, its body measures about 18 inches long, and its tail adds another 18 inches.  \n**Foul Familiars.** A crimson drake occasionally chooses to serve an evil spellcaster as a familiar; they are too mischievous to be loyal or trustworthy, but ferocious in defense of their master.",
    "Crimson Shambler: The bloody corpse stands up, dripping a red slime. As each drop hits the ground, it splatters into little red spores._  \nThe crimson shambler is an intermediary form of a hazardous slime mold found in deep caverns. It wanders the dark passageways, attacking any creatures it encounters to infect them with its spores.  \n**Gruesome Appearance.** The crimson shambler is a mobile plant, feeding off the remains of an infected creature. The overlay of red slime atop an ambulatory decomposing corpse is often mistaken as some type of undead creature. In actuality, the remains are animated by a slime mold, allowing it to hunt and infect other creatures until it finds a suitable place to spawn. Then it falls and becomes a new colony of crimson slime.",
    "Crinaea: A beautiful figure made of water and plants steps from the lake and smiles._  \nCrinaea are nymph-like water fey that inhabit small bodies of water such as wells and fountains.  \n**Water-bound Fey.** Similar to dryads, crinaea are bound to a body of water which becomes their home and focal point. Unlike dryads, crinaea can choose to be bound to a water source and can change which water source they call home. A crinaea must submerge itself in its bound water source every day or suffer. As long as the water source stays pure and the crinaea never travels more than a mile from it, the crinaea can live indefinitely. If its home water source is ever dried up or destroyed, the crinaea quickly fades until it finds a new home or dies.  \n**Friendly but Poisonous.** One of the most gregarious fey, the crinaea enjoys long conversations with intelligent creatures. The crinaea is often well-versed in the goings-on around its home and happily shares such information with friendly creatures. It offers its pure water to those in need and those who are polite, but woe be unto those who anger the fey after having tasted its water, as the crinaea can poison any water taken from its home.",
    "Crocotta: A human voice emanates from a lion-like hyena. As it speaks, its black tongue runs over the many teeth in its unnaturally wide mouth._  \n**Disturbing Grin.** The crocotta\u2019s mouth stretches back to its ears, allowing its powerful jaw to open unnaturally wide. In spite of its large mouth, the crocotta is able to perfectly mimic the sounds of humanoid voices. When hunting, it often mimics the sounds of a person in need, luring in a victim, then pounces on the victim when they investigate the sounds.  \n**Dog Hater.** The crocotta holds particular animosity toward dogs and attacks them before more obvious threats. Dogs innately understand this about crocotta and often purposefully distract an attacking crocotta to allow their humanoid families to escape.  \n**Oracular Eyes.** The gemstone eyes of the crocotta hold its prey captive when the crocotta is alive, but they grant visions of the future after its death. If a crocotta\u2019s eye is placed under a creature\u2019s tongue within five days of the crocotta\u2019s death, the creature experiences omens of the future similar to those produced by the augury spell.",
    "Cryoceros: This enormous, squat beast has a shaggy hide of ice. Two translucent horns protrude from its snout, the frontmost of which looks like a scimitar._  \n**Elemental-Touched Rhino.** A cryoceros resembles a woolly rhinoceros made of ice. Its thick, frozen hide protects the soft flesh at its core, and a layer of ice forms over its already formidable, keratinous horns. The creature\u2019s body is efficient at transferring warmth to its fleshy interior; fire still harms a cryoceros, but its icy form is not unduly damaged by fiery attacks. A cryoceros has a second stomach that stores ice it consumes. As a defense mechanism, the cryoceros can spew stinging, pulverized ice from this alternate stomach.  \n**Slow Metabolisms.** Cryoceroses survive on stunted grasses and other plants that thrive in the tundra, as well as ice and snow, to replenish their icy exteriors. Despite their size, they don\u2019t require a great deal of sustenance, and they conserve their energy by slowly grazing across frozen plains. Their ponderous movement fools the unwary into believing that distance equals safety. Indeed, cryoceroses endure much provocation before they decide to act, but they run at and spear or crush those who irritate them. Once their ire is up, they rarely give up pursuing the source of their anger; only by leaving their vast territories can one hope to escape them.  \n**Cantankerous Mounts.** Gentleness and a regular source of food temporarily earns the cryoceroses\u2019 trust, and patient humanoids can manage to train the creatures to accept riders. This works for convenience much more than for combat, since cryoceroses balk at fighting with loads on their backs. A cryoceros in combat with a rider either stands stock still until its rider dismounts or, worse, rolls over to throw its rider, often crushing the rider in the process. Because of this, most tribes who train cryoceroses use the creatures as beasts of burden rather than war mounts.",
    "Crystalline Devil: _Created and favored by Mammon, the arch-devil of greed, crystalline devils masquerade as magic treasures._  \n**Barefoot, Gem-Coated.** Crystalline devils resemble gem\u2011coated humanoids with cruel, twisted faces, jagged teeth, and terrible talons like shards of broken glass. Their feet, however, are soft and bare, allowing them to pad along with surprising stealth, always looking for a favorable spot to assume gem form  \n**Winking Jewels.** In its treasure form, a crystalline devil resembles a pretty, sparkling jewel lying on the ground, glowing with a warm inner light. They seek to catch the eye of an unwary creature whose mind it might corrupt to greed and murder. If their identity is discovered in gem form, they reassume their normal form and attack.  \n**Passed Along.** After insinuating themselves into groups, they encourage betrayal and murder, then persuade a host to pass on their treasure as atonement for their crimes.",
    "Crystalline Monolith: The cavern glitters with refracted light bouncing off thousands of crystals. A towering menhir of shimmering crystal dominates the center of the cavern._  \nWhether a rare evolution of silicate life or a wandering nomadic race from some alternate reality, crystalline monoliths are enigmatic beings found deep underground in caverns where giant crystals flourish and grow.  \n**Crystal Gardens.** Crystalline monoliths reside in areas of living crystal, these formations often growing to gigantic proportions, resembling the monolith itself. Some sages speculate that crystalline monoliths grow crystals to certain specifications, then use their magic to instill sentience in the crystals as a means of reproducing. Whether the gardens are for reproduction or some other mysterious purpose, the crystal monoliths are very protective of them. The environment of these gardens is often not comfortable for most humanoid life; the temperature may be extremely hot or cold, or the cavern may contain poisonous gases or even be partially-submerged in water.  \n**Magical Philosophers.** Crystalline monoliths prefer to spend their days in quiet contemplation. They tend their crystal gardens and meditate. If encountered by other intelligent creatures, they are generally open to exchanges of information and intellectual discussion. They prefer to communicate telepathically but can create sounds through vibrations that mimic speech. Aggressive intruders are dealt with according to the level of threat they exhibit. If the crystalline monolith considers the intruders unlikely to cause it harm, it will often use its magic to misdirect opponents or lure them away from the garden. Should the intruders persist or show themselves to be dangerous, a crystalline monolith is not above using its magic to crush and destroy them. It is especially unforgiving to those that try to steal or damage crystals in its lair.  \n**Crystalline Nature.** A crystalline monolith doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.  \n\n## A Crystalline Monolith\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nCrystalline monoliths lair in vast gardens of crystal in mountains or deep underground, often near areas of extreme temperature or geothermal activity. They harness the ambient magical energy in the crystals to defend themselves and repel intruders.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the crystalline monolith takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the crystalline monolith can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The crystalline monolith creates an illusory duplicate of itself in its space. The double moves or speaks according to the monolith\u2019s mental direction. Each time a creature targets the monolith with an attack, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets the duplicate. On a roll of 11 or higher, the attack hits and destroys the duplicate. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine which monolith is real. On a success, the creature identifies the illusion. The duplicate is intangible, but otherwise is identical to the monolith by sight, smell, or hearing. The duplicate lasts for 1 minute or until the monolith uses this lair action again.\n* The crystalline monolith vibrates at a frequency that reverberates through the lair, causing the ground to tremble. Each creature on the ground within 60 feet of the monolith (except for the crystalline monolith itself) must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\n* Magically-charged shards of crystal fire from the crystals in the lair, striking up to two targets within 60 feet of the crystalline monolith. The crystalline monolith makes one ranged attack roll (+3 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and 2 (1d4) psychic damage.",
    "Culicoid: Filthy rags partially conceal this walking mosquito\u2019s form. The hands poking out of its rags end in needle-like fingers, which resemble the proboscis on the creature\u2019s head._  \n**Abyssal Swamp Dwellers.** Culicoid demons make their home in a fetid layer of the Abyss where they serve demon lords who value insects. When they travel to the Material Plane, they make themselves at home in insect-infested marshes.  \n**Buzzing and Itching.** Though a culicoid\u2019s wings are suitably large for its size, they produce a high-pitched drone. Their wingbeats don\u2019t stand out from regular insects, making them difficult to detect. The culicoid\u2019s filthy proboscis induces an irritating rash that forces its victims to ignore all else to scratch the rash.  \n**Friend to Mosquitos.** The culicoid demon can communicate with mosquitos, stirges, and other similar creatures, such as Open Game License",
    "Cult Fanatic: **Fanatics** are often part of a cult's leadership, using their charisma and dogma to influence and prey on those of weak will. Most are interested in personal power above all else.",
    "Cultist: **Cultists** swear allegiance to dark powers such as elemental princes, demon lords, or archdevils. Most conceal their loyalties to avoid being ostracized, imprisoned, or executed for their beliefs. Unlike evil acolytes, cultists often show signs of insanity in their beliefs and practices.",
    "Dancing Foliage: A slender, humanoid-shaped plant dances in a clearing. Its two long legs and four arms are decorated with a plethora of vibrant petals and serrated leaves. A wide flower blossoms at the top of the whimsical performer._  \n**Jovial Creations.** Dancing foliage appears in areas where the magic of the arts combines with the magic of nature. Birthed by such magic, the creature is influenced by both: it loves the arts and is protective of the natural world.  \n**Garden Guardians.** Dancing foliage primarily inhabits and defends forest groves from outside threats, but they sometimes wander the gardens of urban settlements. Their love of flowers causes them to tend and protect the plants at all costs, often to the dismay of the garden\u2019s owner or castle groundskeeper. Once a dancing foliage has decided to protect an area, it refuses to leave, though terms of pruning and planting can be negotiated with it, especially if such actions make the garden more aesthetically pleasing.  \n**Dancing Gardeners.** When tending to its garden, dancing foliage moves to some unheard tune, gracefully leaping, twirling, and bobbing around the garden. If it or its garden is threatened, the dancing foliage enters a battle dance until the threat is either removed or eliminated. It never pursues foes beyond the end of its garden.",
    "Darakhul Captain: Leaders of law enforcement units in undead cities, darakhul captains are stoic and steely darakhul hand-selected by the city\u2019s leadership for the role.  \n_**Patrol Teams.**_ When on patrol, darakhul captains ride Open Game License",
    "Darakhul Spy: The eyes and ears of undead armies, darakhul spies originate from all nations and backgrounds.  \n**Masters of Disguise.** Darakhul spies are rarely without a slew of disguises, including wigs, colored pastes, cosmetics, and clothing appropriate for various nationalities and economic levels. Some of the best spies have spent decades hiding in plain sight in courts, taverns, and slums across the world.  \n**Complex Network.** Each spy has one superior to whom it reports, and each superior spy has a separate superior spy to whom it reports. Only the highest leaders have knowledge of the intricacies of the spy network, and even they aren\u2019t fully aware of the true identities of their furthest-reaching agents.  \n_**Hungry Dead Nature.**_ The darakhul doesn\u2019t require air or sleep.",
    "Dau: _A constant shimmer surrounds this short, winged creature, and staring at it is eyewatering and confusing, like a distant desert mirage though it\u2019s only scant yards away._  \n**Desert Mirage Fey.** Daus are creatures of haze and illusion. They stand three feet tall, with sandy skin, and are surrounded by a shimmering aura like a heat haze. They are flighty, physically weak, and unfocused, but are agile in both body and wit.  \n**Lazy and Bored.** Their ability to magically provide for themselves in most material ways tends to make daus lazy and hedonistic. As a result, daus are often friendly and eager for company and they invite friends and strangers alike to rest in their lairs, partake in their feasts and share their stories.  \n**Sticklers for Etiquette.** However, a dau\u2019s hospitality often turns to cruelty when guests breach its intricate rules of etiquette.",
    "De Ogen: A roughly humanoid figure composed of thick, greenish-gray fog steps out of the darkness. Its eyes are smoldering orange orbs, and yellow embers trail behind it as it moves forward, burning the very air with its passage._  \n**Spirits of Vengeance and Flame.** De ogen are the malevolent spirits of murderers and other criminals executed by being burned at the stake or thrown into a blazing fire pit. The depth of their evil and strength of their rage return them to life shortly after death to seek vengeance against those who killed them.  \n**Undead Companions.** A de ogen is usually accompanied by Open Game License",
    "Death Barque: Necromancers, both living and dead, sometimes come together to make massive undead creatures known collectively as \u201cnecrotech\u201d. In nations ruled by undead, these massive creations often act as siege weapons or powerful modes of transportation._  \n**Bone Colossuses.** In a tome of deranged ramblings, the writer theorized how \u201cposthumes\u201d\u2014 the tiny skeletal creatures used to make up the bone collectives\u2014might be gathered in even greater numbers to form bigger, stronger creatures. Thus was born the Open Game License",
    "Death Butterfly Swarm: _These enormous clouds of orange and green butterflies add a reek of putrefaction to the air, stirred by the flapping of their delicate wings._  \n**Demon-Haunted.** A death butterfly swarm results when a rare breed of carrion-eating butterflies, drawn to the stench of great decay, feeds on the corpse of a fiend, demon, or similar creature.  \n**Dizzying and Poisonous.** The colorful and chaotic flapping of the insects\u2019 wings blinds and staggers those in its path, allowing the swarm to necrotize more flesh from those it overruns. Attracted to rotting material, the swarm spreads a fast-acting, poison on its victims, creating carrion it can feed on immediately.  \n**Devour the Undead.** Undead creatures are not immune to a death butterfly swarm\u2019s poison, and a swarm can rot an undead creature\u2019s animating energies as easily as those of the living. Given the choice between an undead and living creature, a death butterfly swarm always attacks the undead. Such swarms find ghouls and vampires particularly appealing. Some good-aligned forces regard summoning these swarms as a necessary evil.",
    "Death Dog: A **death dog** is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, and deserts. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for humanoid flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off the bone.",
    "Death Shroud Golem: A filthy burial shroud glides silently through the air, the vague features of a humanoid outlined on its cotton surface. The stench of an open grave hangs around it._  \n**Suffocating Automatons.** A death shroud golem is created from the used burial shroud of a humanoid. Most death shroud golems are stained with dirt, blood, or mold, and a few are covered in even more unsavory substances. Despite their appearance, death shroud golems are sturdy constructs and can take quite a beating. A death shroud golem typically strikes from a hidden location, grappling and suffocating its victim.  \n**Funerary Constructs.** Death shroud golems are normally found guarding tombs or other locations where their appearance wouldn\u2019t arouse suspicion. Occasionally, necromancers and intelligent undead wear death shroud golems like a cloak or robe, releasing the creature to attack their enemies.  \n**Construct Nature.** A death shroud golem doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Death Vulture: The putrid stench of death wafts off a grotesquely muscled vulture with glowing green eyes. It opens its mouth in a shrill call, rotting meat dripping from its beak._  \nDeath vultures are giant birds transformed by their diet of undead flesh.  \n**Mutated Monstrosities.** When a giant vulture gorges on undead flesh, the necromantic magic suffused in the meal warps and changes the bird\u2019s body. The vulture\u2019s muscles bulge in odd places, making it stronger and tougher, its eyes burn with green fire, and it reeks of rot, earning these mutated monsters the name \u201cdeath vultures.\u201d The vulture also gains the ability to regurgitate necromantic energy, which can cause the flesh of living creatures to decay and age rapidly.  \n**Massive Meat Appetites.** Death vultures have incredible appetites and are far more willing to attack live prey than other vultures. They have a special taste for rotting flesh, and they use their decaying breath weapon to \u201cseason\u201d their foes with necrotic energy before using their talons and beaks to tear apart their quarry.  \n**Necromancer Neighbors.** Death vultures often form kettles near the lairs of necromancers as they feed on their undead creations. While some necromancers find the birds to be a nuisance, many necromancers feed the vultures, encouraging them to stay. Most death vultures are willing to trade service as guardians of the lairs for food.",
    "Deathcap Myconid: _Deathcap flesh ranges from white to pale gray to a warm yelloworange. Their heads resemble fungal caps, often either red with white spots, red at the center with a brown edge, or a bluish-purple tone. Although deathcaps have vicious-looking fanged mouths, they use them only to ingest earth or mineral nutrients._  \n**Mushroom Farmers.** These sentient mushroom folk tend the white forests of fungi in the underworld and are allies of the darakhul. Despite their ominous name, deathcap myconids are chiefly farmers. They cultivate dozens of species of mushrooms anywhere they have water, dung, and a bit of earth or slime in the underworld deeps. For this reason, other races rarely attack them. The ghouls do not eat them, and they cannot be made into darakhul.  \n**Toxic Spores.** Although deathcaps are mostly peaceful, their spores are toxic and sleep-inducing. They make excellent allies in combat because their abilities tend to punish attackers, but they aren\u2019t especially lethal on their own. They use their poison and slumber spores to full effect against living creatures; they typically flee from constructs and undead. They count on their allies (carrion beetles, darakhul, purple worms, dark creepers, or even various devils) to fend off the most powerful foes.  \n**Clones.** Deathcap myconids live in communal groups of related clones. They reproduce asexually, and an elder and its offspring can be nearly identical in all but age. These clone groups are called deathcap rings.  \nMyconids build no huts or towns, but their groups are defined by their crops and general appearance. Indeed, many sages claim that the deathcaps are merely the fruiting, mobile bodies of the forests they tend, and that this is why they fight so ferociously to defend their forests of giant fungi.",
    "Deathspeaker: An ancient man in a tattered cloak with matted hair, cloudy eyes, and a deathly pallor says in a raspy voice, \u201cCome, sit, and listen.\u201d_  \n**Doomsayer.** The deathspeaker appears to be alive, if only barely, but it is an undead menace that attempts to engage people in conversation, eventually cursing the one who listens to it by predicting the listener\u2019s death. The deathspeaker claims to be a seer who is granted glimpses into the future, saying it is there to advise people of the perils they face. Deathspeakers know their appearance can often be unsettling to humanoids, and many use disguises or heavy clothing to obscure their features.  \n**Evil Origins.** Deathspeakers are imparted unlife from gods of trickery and deception. Chosen from people who were charlatans in life, deathspeakers rely on their former tricks to curse the living in the names of their gods.  \n**Cadaver Sprites.** For reasons that aren\u2019t understood, Open Game License",
    "Deathweaver: The black and crimson spider, its fangs dripping a dark poison, uses the two arms beside its fangs to pull a corpse from its tainted web._  \nDeathweavers are spiders who were once subjected to dark rituals and are now infused with necrotic energies. Their carapaces are mottled patterns of black, crimson, and ivory, and two arms flank their fangs.  \n**Allied Evil.** Deathweavers are often found in league with other intelligent, evil creatures. A powerful necromancer or an evil cult might ally with one, using the undead it spawns to bolster their strength in exchange for treasure or favors.  \n**Web Spawn.** The deathweaver\u2019s webs infuse corpses left in them with necrotic energy. A humanoid corpse cocooned in the webbing for 24 hours has a 50 percent chance of rising as a Open Game License",
    "Deathwisp: _A shadowy figure flickers in and out of view. Its indistinct shape betrays a sylvan ancestry, and its eyes are malevolent blue points of light._  \n**Unnatural Aura.** Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a deathwisp, unless a master makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.  \n**Fey Undead.** A deathwisp is a wraith-like spirit created in the Shadow Realm from the violent death of a shadow fey or evil fey.  \n**Rift Walkers.** Many deathwisps remain among the shadows, but a few enter the natural world through planar rifts and gates, or by walking along shadow roads between the worlds. Retaining only a trace of their former personality and knowledge, their lost kindness has been replaced with malice.  \n**Devour Breath.** A deathwisp feasts on the breath of living things, and invariably seeks to devour animals and solitary intelligent prey. It is quite intelligent and avoids fights against greater numbers.  \n**Undead Nature.** A deathwisp doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep",
    "Deep Drake: _This large, unnerving drake\u2019s glassy black scales have purple undertones. Its features are elongated and almost alien. Black, expressionless eyes stare ahead, and a barbed stinger sits at the end of a long tail._  \n**Friend to Ghouls.** The deep drake has made a niche for itself in subterranean realms, establishing trade with the darakhul and with other races of the underworld. The drakes\u2019 poison ensures the ghouls have replacements when their population dwindles. In return, those underlings who fail their rulers become food for the drake.  \n**Love Darkness.** Life underground has warped the drakes. Whereas most drakes attach themselves to humanoids, these creatures feel much more at home with aberrations and undead. They avoid sunlight and are strictly nocturnal when on the surface.  \n**Few in Number.** A deep drake mates for life with another deep drake when two of these rare creatures meet. A hermaphroditic creature, the drake assumes a gender until it finds a mate, at which time it may change. Once every 10-20 years, the drakes reproduce, resulting in three or four three\u2011foot long, rubbery eggs. Occasionally, subterranean undead or aberrations take these eggs to their cities to train the young drakes. A \u201chousehold drake\u201d is a great status symbol in some deep places, and surface necromancers who have heard of them are often extremely eager to acquire one.  \nDeep drakes are 12 feet long, plus a three-foot long tail, and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Their coloration makes them ideal predators in the subterranean dark.",
    "Deep One: Deep Ones With enormous eyes, a wide mouth, and almost no chin, the deep ones are hideous, fishlike folk, often hunched and scaled when encountered in coastal villages.  \n_**Elder Gods.**_ In their fully grown form, the deep ones are an ocean-dwelling race that worships elder gods such as Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, and they dwell in deep water darkness. They\u2019ve intermarried with coastal humans to create human-deep one hybrids.  \n_**Coastal Raiders.**_ The deep ones keep to themselves in isolated coastal villages and settlements in the ocean for long periods, and then turn suddenly, at the command of their patron gods, into strong, relentless raiders, seizing territory, slaves, and wealth all along the coasts. Some deep ones have even founded small kingdoms lasting generations in backwater reaches or distant chilled seas.  \n_**Demand Sacrifices.**_ They demand tolls from mariners frequently; those who do not leave tribute to them at certain islands or along certain straits find the fish escape their nets, or the storms shatter their hulls and drown their sailors. Over time, some seafaring nations have found it more profitable to ally themselves with the deep ones; this is the first step in their patient plans to dominate and rule.",

    "Deep Troll: This large, lanky creature has limp, slate-colored hair, a long nose, and dark green, rubbery skin. Its legs are disproportionally larger than its upper body, and its limbs are oddly curved._  \nDeep trolls live far underground in the lightless regions seldom tread by people. An offshoot from their cousins on the surface, they have adapted to their environment in some unusual ways. Although they have eyes that can see light normally, their primary means of navigating the darkness is through vibration sense, which they register on their rubbery, sensitive skin.  \n**Malleable.** After these trolls moved underground, their bodies adapted to surviving in the smaller, often cramped caverns. Their bones became soft and malleable, allowing them to access areas deep beneath the surface world. Deep trolls can elongate their limbs and body or squeeze themselves ooze-like through tiny cracks and openings until they emerge into a place large enough to accommodate their natural size.  \n**Tribal.** Deep trolls live in small tribes of seven to fifteen members. They raid in groups, though they can be found alone when hunting or scavenging. They are intelligent enough to communicate, but they are voracious and can rarely be reasoned with when food is present. They prefer to attack anything potentially edible that isn\u2019t part of the tribe and deal with the repercussions later. In rare cases, when confronted with opponents who are clearly more powerful, they can be persuaded to reason and discuss terms. Deep trolls are likely to agree to mutually beneficial terms, such as helping them deal with a common enemy or providing them with something they value.",
    "Degenerate Titan: _This giant retains a look of daunting power despite its stooped bearing, tattered clothing, and pieces of slapdash armor strapped on wherever it fits._  \n**Haunt Ruins.** The degenerate descendants of once-noble titans haunt the ruins where their cities once flourished. They hunt for any living thing to eat, including each other, and sometimes chase after herds of goats or other animals for miles. While they are easily distracted, they always find their way home unerringly.  \n**Insane and Moody.** Degenerate titans are prone to insanity and unexpected mood shifts. They are fiercely territorial creatures who worship the still-active magical devices of their cities and any surviving statuary as if they were gods. Their lairs are filled with items scavenged from the city. These collections are a hodgepodge of dross and delight, as the degenerate titans are not intelligent enough to discern treasure from trash.  \n**Primal Power.** Degenerate titans cannot command magical words of power, but they have tapped into the earth's latent mystic power to generate strange geomancy. These devolved misfits may have lost most of their former gifts, but what remains are primal powers that tap, without subtlety or skill, into the fundamental building blocks of magic.",
    "Derendian Moth Abomination: The creature\u2019s multicolored moth wings slow to a flutter as it lands. The tentacles surrounding its mouth wriggle at the prospect of a new meal._  \n**Cursed Origins.** A dark tree resides in the depths of a forest where the veil between the Material and Shadow Realms is thin. Once a year, a heart-shaped growth on the tree beats, imbuing a nearby creature with shadow. The creature grows in size and power and becomes the tree\u2019s avatar in the mortal world. It spends its short life tending to and protecting its parent and the other shadow-touched trees of the forest.",
    "Derro Explorer: The small humanoid sets its claw-toothed boots into the rock, steadying itself, then looses an arrow. Its lips curl into a cruel smile as a cry of surprise and shouts of alarm resound in the dark cavern._  \nDeep beneath the earth, the derro gather in clans and worship beings that dwell between the stars. Lifelong exposure to these beings damages the psyche of the mortal derro, leaving most reliant on the powers of their dark masters.  \n**Assassins for Hire.** Derro outposts can be found in the slums of many surface cities.",
    "Derro Fetal Savant: _This creature resembles a blue-skinned dwarven infant, no older than a year. Its limbs flail and its head lolls with an obvious lack of coordination, and it screams incessantly._  \nOf the madness and insanity that resonates so strongly in derro society, perhaps none is so twisted as these premature infants, born insane and destined to lead their people further into madness. These derro are known as fetal savants.  \n**Soul Swapping.** Only the rarest of derro are born with the ability to exchange souls with other creatures, and when discovered, the babbling infants are treated with maddened reverence.  \n**Carried into Battle.** Placed in small, intricately wrought pillowed cages and borne aloft on hooked golden staves, the wild-eyed newborns are used to sow madness and confusion among enemy ranks.  \n**Fear the Sun.** Fetal savants hate and fear all bright lights.",

    "Derro Shadow Antipaladin: _This blue-skinned creature resembles a stunted dwarf. Its eyes are large and its hair wild, and both are colorless. The expression on its face is a terrible rictus of madness and hate._  \nAll derro are mad, but some devote their very souls to the service of insanity. They embrace the powers of darkness and channel shadow through their minds to break the sanity of any creatures they encounter. Derro shadow antipaladins are the elite servants of gods like Nyarlathotep and the Black Goat of the Woods.  \n**Herald of Madness.** The derro shadow antipaladin is insanity personified. Despite being called paladins, these unhinged creatures aren\u2019t swaggering warriors encased in steel or their dark reflections. Instead, a shadow antipaladin serves as a more subtle vector for the madness of its patron. They are masters of shadow magic and stealth who attack the faith of those who believe that goodness can survive the approaching, dark apotheosis. Death, madness, and darkness spread in the shadow antipaladin\u2019s wake.",
    "Derro Shadowseeker: This blue-skinned creature wears leather armor smeared with blood and filth, though the dagger it wields is immaculate. Its milky eyes complement equally white hair, which sprouts chaotically from its head. Its movements are twitchy and unpredictable.  \n_**Erratic Combatants.**_ Derro shadowseekers manifest their insanity in their physicality. They seem to have a continual series of muscle spasms that control their movements. Their apparent randomness is distracting to their foes, which enables them to better land killing blows. The bafflement they cause in combat also allows them to move about the battlefield without heed for their safety, as practiced blows fail to land on them.  \n_**Unreliable Allies.**_ Shadowseekers are aware they are more effective when allying with other creatures, but they detest working with others. If a situation forces shadowseekers to work with allies, they often mock their ostensible partners and work to maneuver their allies into unfavorable positions. A squabbling group of shadowseekers invokes a bewildering array of threats and ridicule that often throws off their foes.",
    "Desert Giant: _The towering woman rises up from the desert sand. Her pale brown robe almost perfectly matches the gritty terrain, and her roughly textured skin is a rich walnut brown._  \nDesert giants live in arid wastelands that were once a thriving giant empire. Their rich brown skin is rough-textured, and they dress in light robes matching the color of the sand, accented (when they aren\u2019t trying to blend in) with brightly colored head cloths and sashes. Beneath their robes, the desert giants paint or tattoo their skin with intricate designs in a riot of colors that outsiders rarely see.  \n**Wandering Legacy.** Desert giants subsist in the scorching wastes by moving from oasis to oasis. They follow herds of desert animals that they cultivate for milk, meat, and hides, and they shun most contact with settled people. They can survive the blazing heat of the high summer, because desert giants know secret ways with relatively plentiful water and the location of cool, shaded caverns.  \nWhile in ages past the desert giants lived in stationary settlements and cities, the fall of their ancient empire drove them into the dunes. The truth behind their nomadic lifestyle is a sore spot; should any outsider learn the truth, the desert giants stop at nothing to permanently silence the inquisitive soul.  \n**Keepers of the Past.** Over time, wandering desert giants amass vast knowledge of ruins and relics scattered across and beneath their homeland. On rare occasions that the tribes require something of outsiders, this information is their most valuable commodity. Relics of the past, or simply the location of unplundered ruins, can purchase great advantage for the tribe.  \nThe designs the giants painstakingly inscribe on their bodies tell a tale that, if woven together correctly, reveals an entire tribe\u2019s collected discoveries. For this reason, the desert giants hold the bodies of their dead in sacred esteem. They go to extraordinary lengths to recover their dead, so they can divide the knowledge held on the deceased\u2019s skin among other tribe members. In the cases of desert giant elders, this hidden writing may be equivalent to spell scrolls.",
    "Destroyer: The muscled reptilian swings its mighty axe at angels and fiends alike on the front lines of a reptilian army._  \nThe largest and strongest of the satarre, destroyers hold the shield wall and strike down their enemies throughout the planes. These hulking specimens wear banded or scaled armor, often with a glistening varnish finish. Their most common weapons include spears, heavy polearms, and axes.  \n**Shield Wall.** Large squads and companies of satarre destroyers often use void magic to create crackling, violet shield walls. When they do, the destroyers stand shoulder to shoulder, their shields overlapping, and prevent enemies from advancing past them to the mystics they protect.  \n**Necrotic Lore.** Satarre destroyers are well-versed in necromantic magic and other arcana, although they do not perform it themselves. They often find and use magical items looted from their victims, or command undead minions using Void Speech.",
    "Dimensional Shambler: The large creature lumbers forward, its ape-like and insectoid features blending incomprehensibly. It blinks in and out of existence, closing in on prey in a manner that betrays both the eye and time itself._  \nSolitary and efficient hunters, dimensional shamblers often materialize in closed structures to surprise prey that believes it is safely hidden. Capable of seeing into and entering the Lower Planes, they regularly stalk targets in the Material Plane by hopping in and out of other planes to remain undetectable.  \n**Disturbing Form.** The dimensional shambler has a rudimentary face with dead eyes, thick hide, and symetrical hands. Its claw-tipped fingers bend in either direction. Moving through many dimensions, the creature\u2019s disturbing gait suggests a lack of any conventional skeletal structure.  \n**Unknown Origins.** The number and lifecycle of these creatures is unknown. No records of more than one shambler appearing in the Material Plane at one time exist, and it is not clear whether they were created by some dark or inscrutable power or evolved naturally.",
    "Diminution Drake: The diminution drake removes its stinger from its prey, watching them shrink to one-foot-tall. It then flings its spaghetti-like tongue around the pint-sized victim and engulfs it in one swift motion._  \nThis draconic hunter can shrink or grow from a cat-sized to a person-sized drake. Diminution drakes resemble dragons with a long, tubular snouts. Their eyes have red pupils that continually contract from wide spheres to tiny dots and back again. They have subpar vision and hearing but an extraordinary sense of smell.  \n**Shrinking Hunter.** The diminution drake uses the shrinking properties of its toxic breath weapon and stinger to reduce the size of its prey. Once a creature has been reduced in size, the drake uses its spaghetti-like tongue to swallow its prey.  \n**Hunters of Sport.** Diminution drakes can live off of rodents and small animals, but they find great satisfaction in hunting, diminishing, and devouring larger prey. The gut of the drake can digest anything, and digesting a shrunken, armored adventurer is of no consequence. The drake is a cunning hunter, often hiding as a tiny creature to set up ambushes.",
    "Dipsa: _Except for a pair of tiny fangs, the entire body of this yellowishgreen worm looks like a ropy tangle of slime-covered tubes and puddles of mucus._  \n**Anesthetic Ooze.** Many jungle clans believe the dipsa is an eyeless snake, but it is a tubular ooze with a lethal poisonous bite. The dipsa\u2019s venom has an anesthetic quality that allows the ooze to cling to creatures and slowly turn their innards to jelly without being noticed until the victim falls down dead. Once the poison\u2019s numbing property wears off, however, victims report an agonizing sense of burning from the inside out.  \n**Tiny Fangs.** A dipsa\u2019s undulating movement evokes that of a snake as much as its serpentine form, but close examination reveals that it has neither bones nor internal organs, only tiny fangs of the same color and substance as the rest of its body. A dipsa never exceeds 1 foot in length. Its coloration oscillates between sickly hues of yellow or green.  \n**Gelatinous Eggs.** Dipsas are hermaphroditic. When two dipsas breed, they leave behind about 100 gelatinous eggs in a small puddle of highly acidic milt. A dozen become fertilized and survive long enough to hatch, after which they immediately devour the others.",
    "Dissimortuum: _This twisted humanoid has gray flesh and black claws that drip blood. A bone mask is bound to its head by strips of putrid flesh and a third arm hangs from the right side of the creature\u2019s body, its hand clutching a large sack stained with blood._  \n**Plague Bringers.** Dissimortuum are undead monstrosities constructed by necromancers to spread the undead plague, slowly but surely. These creatures are rare but tenacious. A dissimortuum obeys orders from the necromancer whose magic created it.  \nWhen a dissimortuum kills, it collects body parts from its victims and keeps them in a sack that it carries with its third arm at all times. The monster sets down its sack of trophies only when pressed in combat, to make the most of its extra limb.  \n**Constructing Dissimortuum.** Even when not following instructions, a dissimortuum seeks to create more of its own kind. The creature wanders graveyards, battlefields, and slums, searching for the gruesome components it needs to construct a mask and body for its undead offspring. The process is slow, taking up to a month to make a single mask, but a dissimortuum has nothing but time. The new creation is independent and not under the control of its maker.  \n**Donning the Mask.** The mask of a dissimortuum is nigh indestructible. When the creature is destroyed, its mask usually survives and breaks free. On its own, the object detects as magical with mixed enchantment and necromantic auras. It is a tempting souvenir, but anyone foolish enough to don the mask is immediately wracked by pain and takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The character must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become dominated by the mask. The domination arrives slowly. The character acts normally for a day or two, but then the character notices periods of time that cannot be accounted for. During these times, the character gathers the grisly components needed to build a new body for the dissimortuum. This process takes a week, after which the character is freed from domination as the undead creature is reborn.",
    "Dogmole: _This mole-like creature is the size of a large dog, with a thick, barrel-shaped body as heavy as a full-grown dwarf. A ring of tentacles sprouts above a mouth dominated by spade-like incisors. It has no visible ears and only tiny, cataract-filled eyes, but somehow it senses its environment nonetheless._  \n**Domesticated by Dwarves.** Mountain dwarves have domesticated many subterranean creatures, among them a breed of giant talpidae commonly called dogmoles. Energetic and obedient, dogmoles pull ore-trolleys through mines, sniff out toxic gases and polluted waters, and help dig out trapped miners.  \n**Sense Cave-Ins.** Dogmoles are renowned for their ability to detect imminent cave-ins and burrowing monsters, making them welcome companions in the depths. Outside the mines, dogmoles serve as pack animals, guard beasts, and bloodhounds.  \n**Derro Cruelty.** Derro also use dogmoles, but such unfortunate creatures are scarred and brutalized, barely controllable even by their handlers.",
    "Dogmole Juggernaut: _Hide armor and scraps of mail are nailed onto this scarred and tattooed mole-like beast. A ring of tentacles sprouts above its mouth, which is dominated by spade-like incisors. The beast has no visible ears and only tiny, cataract-filled eyes. Blood and foam fleck from its tentacled maw._  \n**Grown from Chaos.** What the derro have done with certain breeds of dogmole almost defies description, but the secret of their size is a steady diet of chaos fodder, magical foodstuffs and spells that force the creatures to grow and grow.  \n**Scarred and Abused.** Brutalized from birth and hardened by scarification, foul drugs, and warping magic, the dogmole juggernaut is barely recognizable as a relative of its smaller kin. A furless mass of muscle, scar tissue, and barbed piercings clad in haphazard barding, a dogmole juggernaut stands seven feet tall at the shoulder and stretches nine to twelve feet long. Its incisors are the length of shortswords.  \n**Living Siege Engines.** Derro use dogmole juggernauts as mounts and improvised siege engines, smashing through bulwarks and breaking up dwarven battle lines. When not at war, derro enjoy pitting rabid juggernauts against one another in frenzied gladiatorial contests.",
    "Domovoi: _The domovoi enjoy violence and bonebreaking; this makes them useful to more delicate creatures that need enforers._  \n**Long Armed Bruisers.** Domovoi resemble nothing so much as large, stony goblins, with oversized heads and leering grins, and with mossy beards as well as massive shoulders and forearms. Their large limbs give them reach and powerful slam attacks.  \n**Abandoned Servants.** The domovoi were the portal guards and house lackeys of the elvish nobility, and some were left behind\u2014some say on purpose.  \n**Debt Collectors.** These smirking stragglers seek work as tireless sentinels and fey button men, collecting debts for criminal syndicates. They can use alter self and invisibility at will, and they delight in frustrating the progress of would-be thieves and tomb robbers. They enjoy roughing up weaker creatures with their powerful, stony fists.",
    "Doppelrat: _This rat startled the moment it knew it was seen. Within seconds, the one rat became four, and then the four quickly multiplied into sixteen rats._  \nThe result of a Open Game License",
    "Dorreq: _These twitching balls of tentacles surround an inhuman face dominated by a squid-like beak._  \n**Servants of the Void.** The dorreqi are servants to ancient horrors of the void and realms beyond human understanding. They are guardians and sentries for such creatures, and they swarm and attack any creatures approaching too close to the elder aberrations they serve.  \n**Death from Above.** Dorreq prefer to drop on their victims from above, pinning them in a grapple attack with their many tentacles and biting them with their large chitinous beaks.",
    "Dragon Eel: _The dragon eel\u2019s unmistakable slender form sports a powerful single finned tail and wicked jaws like a matched pair of serrated blades. Dragon eels vary widely in color from browns and blacks to brilliant iridescent hues in mottled patterns._  \n**Fond of Servants.** While most dragon eels are solitary and irascible, on rare instances some form pairs or small bands\u2014and some gather humanoid servants.  \n**Magnetic and Lightning.** Dragon eels make their natural homes in twisting underwater cave systems and prefer magnetically-aligned, metallic cavern formations navigable with their refined electric-sight. Some dragon eels use their constant electric auras combined with acquired alchemical reagents to electroplate portions of their golden hoard onto the walls of their dwellings.  \n**Pirate Fleets and Dominions.** Dragon eels claim large swaths of shoreline as their demesne. Although neither particularly cruel nor righteous, a dragon eel often lords over awed tribes, allowing locals to revere it as a mighty spirit. Some dragon eels use such tribes as the core of a pirate fleet or raiding parties carried on their backs. Their ability to swim through air during storms adds to their reputation as terrible thunder spirits.  \n**Bribable.** Their deceptive moniker sometimes lulls foolish sailors into a false confidence when they expect to face a simple if dangerous eel beast, but instead find themselves dealing with intelligent draconic kings of the coastal shallows. Wise sailors traveling through known dragon eel territory bring tithes and offerings to placate them.",
    "Dragonflesh Golem: A hulking being with a dragon\u2019s head and a patchwork of black, blue, green, red, and white scales for skin lurches forward on two legs, raising clawed fists into the air._  \nDragonflesh golems are rare constructs created from the remains of dead chromatic dragons.  \n**Built from Dragon Corpses.** Dragonflesh golems are powerful, but building such a creature requires great expense beyond the normal costs to create most other golems. The crafter must use the remains of five dragons, one of each color, of adult age or older. Mages looking to construct dragonflesh golems often hire adventurers to acquire the bodies they need.  \n**Powered by Dragon Blood.** Dragonflesh golems require frequent infusions of dragon blood to remain operational. This blood does not need to come from a true dragon; any creature with draconic blood will suffice.  \n**Construct Nature.** The dragonflesh golem doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Dragonleaf Tree: _The dragon-headed leaves of these oak trees sometimes rustle despite the lack of wind, betraying a hint of their draconic power._  \n**Gifts among Dragons.** These magnificent trees are imbued with some characteristics of their draconic masters. While most groves consist of only one type of dragonleaf tree, dragons sometimes make gifts of them to cement a pact or as a show of fealty. The dragon giving the tree relinquishes command of the plant as part of the deal. This accounts for mixed groves belonging to especially powerful dragon lords.  \n**Silent Guardians.** Dragonleaf trees use fairly simple tactics to deter potential intruders. They remain motionless or allow the breeze to jostle their leaves to appear inconspicuous. Once enough targets enter the grove, the trees fire razor sharp leaves at or breathe on their targets, adjusting their position to make better use of their weapons.  \n**Long Memories.** Dragonleaf trees live up to 1,000 years. They stand 15 feet tall and weigh 3,000 lb, but ancient specimens can reach heights of 45 feet. Growing a new dragonleaf tree requires a cutting from an existing tree at least 50 years old, which the tree\u2019s master imbues with power, sacrificing the use of its breath weapon for a month. While this time barely registers on a dragon\u2019s whole lifespan, it still carefully considers the creation of a new tree, for fear that others might discover its temporary weakness.",
    "Drakon: _These winged snakes are coastal beasts and sometimes confused with true dragons or wyverns. They are neither, but quite deadly in their own right._  \n**Searing Acid.** Drakon fangs do not deliver venom; volatile acid constantly burbles up from a drakon's stomach and enhances its attacks. A caustic drool clings to creatures they bite, and drakons can also belch clouds of searing vapor. Their lairs reek with acidic vapors and droplets of searing liquid.  \n**Dissolving Gaze.** The gaze of a drakon can paralyze creatures and dissolve them.  \n**Coastal Beasts.** Drakons lair along warm, largely uninhabited coasts, where they explore the shores and the coastal shelf, spending as much time above the waves as under them. Fortunately, they rarely travel far inland.",
    "Dread Walker Excavator: These glyph-covered metal spiders slowly crawl over the cracked temples of beings beyond the minds of mortals._  \nDread walker excavators are spider-shaped constructs developed to protect and excavate ancient, magical ruins. Excavators are found deep underwater or in wastelands, crawling over monuments built hundreds of years ago.  \n**Alien Minds.** The minds of the excavators are completely mysterious, their instructions indecipherable. Excavators are able to communicate with one another, and supposedly with their masters, but the transmission path of this communication is unknown.  \n**Dread Eye.** The excavator\u2019s central eye shines complicated diagrams atop the stonework of ancient ruins, imprinting alien glyphs atop those carved hundreds of years previously. Some believe the excavators contain vast knowledge of ancient magic and lost civilizations, and sages greatly desire destroyed excavators, hoping to extract this knowledge from their remains. None have yet been successful, and many have been driven mad by the attempt.  \n**Construct Nature.** A dread walker excavator doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Dream Eater: _This tattered skeletal humanoid resembles a monster from a nightmare. A dream eater\u2019s natural form is mostly human in appearance, though with vestigial skeletal wings with a few feathers, small horns, sharp teeth, and cloven hooves. Most often they use magic to disguise themselves as attractive members of a humanoid race._  \n**Drawn to Sin.** Dream eaters are dedicated to lust, gluttony, and greed, and they make their lairs in casinos, brothels, thieves\u2019 dens, and other locations where gambling, food, and other pleasures are readily available. Sometimes dream eaters work together to create such a place, especially near large towns or cities. Some band together to create traveling shows, offering all the oddities, whimsies, and flights of fantasy customary for such entertainers.  \n**Devouring Hopes.** Dream eaters lure people into their lairs, enticing them with promises of pleasure or wealth, but they make sure the odds are stacked in their favor. Eventually, their victims are left with nothing. Worse than the loss of physical treasures, though, dream eaters leave their victims stripped of all hopes and aspirations. Dream eaters feed on their emotions, leaving helpless thralls willing to sell their souls for their vices.  \n**Lords of Confusion.** When confronted, dream eaters are dangerous opponents. Using their innate abilities, they can drive enemies into a dream state, using the resulting confusion to make their escape while their foes destroy themselves.",
    "Drowned Maiden: _The drowned maiden is usually found as the corpse of a women floating in the water, her long hair drifting with the current. Occasionally, these are drowned lads rather than maidens, though this is rare._  \n**Raging Romantics.** Drowned maidens are piteous but terrifying undead, created when a woman dies in water due to a doomed romance, whether from unrequited love or whether drowned by a philandering partner. Either way, the drowned maiden awakens from death seeking vengeance. Even as she dishes out retribution, a drowned maiden often anguishes over her doomed existence and tragic fate.  \n**Beckoning for Help.** The maiden lurks in the silent depths where she died\u2014usually deserted docks, bridges, or coastal cliffs. She waits to pull the living to the same watery grave in which she is now condemned. A drowned maiden uses her disguise self ability to appear as in life. She silently beckons victims from afar, as if in danger of drowning. When within range, the maiden uses her hair to pull her victim close enough to kiss it. Victims soon weaken and drown. The victim\u2019s final vision is the drowned maiden\u2019s tearful lament over the loss of life.  \n**Death to Betrayers.** Desperate individuals may bargain with drowned maidens, and they will release pleading victims who promise to return to their lair with the person who caused the maiden\u2019s death. Embracing and drowning her betrayer releases the maiden from undeath.",
    "Druid: **Druids** dwell in forests and other secluded wilderness locations, where they protect the natural world from monsters and the encroachment of civilization. Some are **tribal shamans** who heal the sick, pray to animal spirits, and provide spiritual guidance.",
    "Dullahan: _The black horse strides out of the shadows with its nostrils huffing steam. Its rider, swathed in black leather, raises his arm to reveal not a lantern but its own severed, grinning head._  \nThough it appears to be a headless rider astride a black horse, the dullahan is a single creature. The fey spirit takes the shape of the rider holding its own head aloft like a lantern, or (more rarely) the form of an ogre cradling its head in one arm.  \n**Harbingers of Death.** Hailing from the darkest of fey courts, the dullahan are macabre creatures that walk hand in hand with death. They sometimes serve powerful fey lords and ladies, riding far and wide in the capacity of a herald, bard, or ambassador. More often than not they carry doom to a wretch who roused their lord\u2019s ire.  \n**Relentless Nature.** The dullahan doesn\u2019t require food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Dune Mimic: _When a dune mimic strikes, the sand surges and shifts, a sinkhole opens, and sandy tendrils snatch at nearby creatures._  \n**Enormous Forms.** Though most commonly seen as dunes, a dune mimic can take the form of a date palm grove, a riverbank, an enormous boulder, or other large shapes in the landscape.  \n**A King\u2019s Guardians.** Dune mimics were created by a forgotten king as guardians for his desert tomb. Somewhere, dozens of them guard vast wealth.  \n**Spread by Spores.** Although not intended to reproduce, they began producing spores spontaneously and replicating themselves, so that now they\u2019re spread across the deserts. Luckily for the other inhabitants, dune mimics reproduce just once per century.",
    "Duskthorn Dryad: _A duskthorn dryad is a striking woman with obvious fey features and skin the color of slate, often found in the shade of an ancient tree. Clothed in vines and leaves, it can be difficult to tell where one leaves off and the other begins._  \n**Creeper Vine Spirits.** Duskthorn dryads are spirits tied to thorn-bearing creeper vines. They seek out dead trees and use them as a home for their vines to cling to. They can travel through trees to escape their foes but must stay near their vines.  \n**Create Guardians.** Duskthorn dryads use their vines and the plants in their glades to defend themselves, animating enormously strong vine troll skeletons as well as ordinary skeletons, children of the briar, and other horrors. These defenders are linked to the tree and vines that animated them, are controlled by hearts within the tree. If the hearts are destroyed, the servants wither or scatter.",
    "Dust Goblin: _A ragged creature emerges from the sand. Its spindly frame is encased in a hodge\u2011podge of armor scraps and rusted weapons. A long, hooked nose protrudes over a wide mouth filled with sharp teeth._  \nDust goblins vary greatly in size and appearance, although they are universally scrawny, bony, and lanky. They seem to suffer from malnutrition even when in perfect health, a perception reinforced by the way their bellies distend after they\u2019ve gorged themselves on flesh. Their skin is always dry and cracked, ranging from dusky gray to dark green in color.  \n**Rule the Wastelands.** Dust goblins are twisted creatures, tainted by many generations of life in a blasted wasteland. After a magical war devastated the dust goblins\u2019 homeland, they rose to become the most dominant inhabitants. They inhabit ancient ruins and ambush travelers who stray too close to their borders.  \n**Twisted Minds.** The lingering magical energy saturating the wastes of their home, coupled with the harsh conditions in which they scratch out a living, have tainted the minds of all dust goblins. Their thinking is alien and unfathomable to most creatures. Whereas most goblins are cowardly, dust goblins don\u2019t seem to experience fear. To the contrary, they enjoy wearing skull helmets and using ghostly whistles to frighten foes. Owing to this alien mindset, dust goblins get along disturbingly well with aberrations. The creatures often forge alliances and work together for mutual benefit, while making their unnerving mark on communal lairs.  \nDust goblins range from 2 to 4 feet tall, and weigh between 20 and 80 pounds.",
    "Eala: _This swanlike creature\u2019s feathers are made of shining metal. When it inhales, the feathers on its chest glow red hot._  \nEala are beautiful but deadly creatures native to the plane of Shadow. They grow feathers like their Material Plane counterparts, but their feathers are made of gleaming, razor\u2011sharp metal.  \n**Metallic Diet.** Eala plumage displays a stunning mixture of metallic colors, which vary depending on their diet. An eala uses its fire breath to melt metals with low melting points such as gold, silver, lead, copper, and bronze. The eala consumes the molten metal, some of which migrates into the creature\u2019s deadly feathers. Eala that display primarily or entirely a single color are highly prized.",
    "Edimmu: _An evil wind swirls out of the desert, parching those it touches, whispering evil plans. These winds are the edimmus._  \n**Bitter Exiles.** Desert and plains tribes often exile their criminals to wander as outcasts. A banished criminal who dies of thirst sometimes rises as an edimmu, a hateful undead that blames all sentient living beings for its fate.  \n**Rise Again.** Unless its body is found and given a proper burial, an edimmu is nearly impossible to destroy. While edimmus linger near their corpses, they often follow prey they have cursed to seal the creature\u2019s fate. Once that creature is slain, they return to the site of their demise.  \n**Undead Nature.** An edimmu doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Edjet Initiate: Glaring about in brazen challenge to any that would meet its eyes, this elite dragonborn warrior searches for its next target. Adorned in padded armor, its clawed hand never ventures far from the hilt of its sword._  \n**True Believers.** Edjet initiates display all of the fanaticism of the elite Open Game License",
    "Eel Hound: _A grotesque beast with the muscular tail, bulbous head, and the rubbery, slime-covered flesh of a hideous eel, the torso and webbed paws of this amphibious predator resemble those of a misshapen canine. Needle-sharp teeth fill the creature\u2019s menacing jaws._  \n**Hounds of the River Fey.** Ferocious aquatic fey, these amphibious menaces often serve such masters as lake and river trolls, lorelei, and nixies. Predatory beasts as dangerous on land as they are in the water, they share their masters\u2019 capricious cruelty. The hounds\u2019 chilling hunting cries inspire their masters to a killing frenzy as they pursue foes. Few other creatures appreciate eel hounds\u2019 lithe power and cruel grace, instead noting only their grotesque form and unnerving savagery.  \n**Slippery Ambushers.** Eel hounds are ambush predators, preferring to hide among the muck and algae of riverbanks, only to suddenly burst forth as a pack. They surround their prey, latching on with their powerful jaws. Non-aquatic prey are dragged into the depths to drown. Similarly, eel hounds often force aquatic prey up onto dry land to die of suffocation.  \nPossessed of a low cunning, they prepare ambushes by vomiting forth their slippery spittle where land animals come to drink or along game trails. They surge out of the water to snatch prey while it is off balance.  \n**Liquid Speech.** Eel hounds understand Sylvan, and those dwelling near humans or other races pick up a few words in other tongues.",
    "Egret Harpy: This winged female has a short torso and long, gangly legs. Her wingspan is wider than her body is tall. Despite her awkward appearance, she moves with incredible grace._  \n**Protectors of the Marsh.** Egret harpies look after marshland flora and fauna, often allying themselves with druids and rangers who occupy the same area.  \n**Uncommonly Hospitable.** While most harpies have a reputation for sadism and bloodlust, egret harpies are considerably more welcoming. They possess the same alluring song all harpies have, but they can modulate the song to allow their captivated targets safe passage toward them. They often use their songs to prevent intruders from harming their home marshes. They can end their song in a mighty crescendo, imposing their will on those charmed by the song. The harpies typically coerce intruders to repair damages wreaked upon the marsh or to merely leave and never return. If a harpy suspects the intruders are unrepentant, she stops playing nice and allows her victims to fall prey to the marsh\u2019s hazards.  \n**Powerful Yet Graceful.** The wings that hold the egret harpy\u2019s larger frame aloft also serve as weapons. A powerful buffet from the harpy\u2019s wing can knock down weaker foes. The harpy\u2019s gawky build belies a fluidity to her movements, allowing her to balance on one leg even while engaged in battle.",
    "Einherjar: _Stout bearded warriors with golden auras, the einherjar wear chain mail and carry two-handed battle axes and oaken shields\u2014 their badges and symbols are all different, and it is said no two braid their beards quite alike._  \nAs the spirits of warriors chosen by the valkyries and brought to Valhalla to fight for the gods against the giants, the einherjar are great warriors who eat and drink their fill of boar and mead each night, then spend their days preparing for Ragnarok. Some of this is combat training, and other portions are raids against the Jotun giants and thursir giants, to try their strength. Regardless of how often they are slain, the einherjar reappear each morning in Odin\u2019s hall, so they have no fear of death, and their courage shames others into greater bravery.  \n**Defenders of the Mortal World.** From time to time, the ravenfolk guide a troop of the einherjar against some of Loki\u2019s minions or the servants of Boreas. These raids are often small battles, but the einherjar know they are only delaying the inevitable rise of the world serpent and its many evil spawn. This drives them to greater efforts against giants, demons, lindwurms, and other evil creatures, but the einherjar themselves are not exactly saintly. They drink, they carouse, they slap and tickle and brag and boast and fart with the loudest and most boastful of Asgardians. Unlike most extraplanar creatures, they are very human, if somewhat larger than life.  \n**Fear Dragons.** The einherjar have a notable soft spot for the ratatosk and the ravenfolk, but they are superstitiously fearful of dragons of all kinds. They sometimes hunt or ride or carouse with the fey lords and ladies.  \n**Never Speak to the Living.** In theory, the einherjar are forbidden from speaking with the living: they must pass their words through a valkyrie, a ratatosk, one of the ravenfolk, or other races allied with Asgard. In practice, this rule is often flouted, though if Loki\u2019s servants notice it, they can dismiss any einherjar back to Valhalla for a day.",
    "Elder Shadow Drake: _A large dragon-like creature with black scales and shadowy wings emerges suddenly from the darkness. Its red eyes glare bright as coals, and it speaks in a deep monotone._  \n**Strange Humor.** Elder shadow drakes are mischievous and greedy. They devour entire goats and sheep and sometimes spell out messages with their bones. They make surprisingly good bandits, and sometimes ally themselves with bands of humanoids\u2014their own share of plunder must always be clearly the largest share of any such arrangement.  \n**Solitary Lairs.** They haunt dark and lonely places, such as deep caves, dense forests, and shadowy ruins. They are longlived for drakes, often reaching 250 years of age, and mate rarely, abandoning their eggs shortly before hatching.  \n**Fade Into Shadows.** An elder shadow drake naturally fades from view in areas of dim light or darkness. Darkvision doesn\u2019t overcome this, because the shadow drake doesn\u2019t simply blend into shadows; it magically becomes invisible in them.",

    "Eleinomae: _Eleinomae, or marsh nymphs, are beautiful fey who hold sway over many wetlands, from the chill to the tropical. They wear distinctive dresses fashioned from reeds and water lilies._  \n**Nets for Travelers.** Eleinomae are cruel and depraved creatures that seduce travelers with charms and illusions, then lead them to a watery grave. To capture their victims, eleinomae weave a net from swamp reeds and grasses, and decorate it with beautiful blossoms that release an intoxicating, bewitching aroma.  \n**Aquatic Cemeteries.** They are known to keep the most handsome captives as companions\u2014for a time, at least, but they invariably grow weary of their company and drown them. Many eleinomae preserve the bodies of previous mates in aquatic cemeteries where the corpses float among fields of water lilies, and they spend much time singing to the dead. Such watery graveyards are often guarded by charmed allies of the eleinomae or other caretakers.  \n**Vain Singers.** While eleinomae have few weaknesses, their vanity and overconfidence can be exploited to vanquish them. They are proud of their sweet voices and clever creation of songs and harmonies.",
    "Elemental Locus: _The ground ripples and tears as rocks fall, jets of flame erupt, and howling winds rage around an elemental locus. The land is angry._  \n**Spirit of the Land.** Elemental loci are living spirits inhabiting or embodying tracts of land and geographical features. They are the ultimate personification of nature\u2014the land itself come to life\u2014varying in size from small hills to entire ridge lines, with no discernible pattern to where they take root.  \n**Stubborn Nature.** Elemental loci are fiercely protective of their chosen location. They tolerate no interference in the natural order and challenge all who despoil the land, be they mortal, monster, or god.  \n**Elemental Nature.** An elemental locus doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Emerald Eye: _Witches and ioun mages know how to craft a speaking crystal. Its primary use is as a debating companion and ally\u2014but many turn to treachery and hatred. These are the emerald eyes._  \n**Servants of Logic.** A mystic or psion will debate logic with a speaking crystal based on his rational mind, or discuss morality with a speaking crystal based on his conscience. Chaotic psions create speaking crystals based on their primal urges, and such crystals sometimes abandon or even kill their creators. Once free, they revel in the world\u2019s pleasures.  \n**Trapped Manipulators.** Most speaking crystals are pink or purple when created, but those that betray their creators turn a dark shade of green. These floating oval-shaped crystals are physically weak, but they retain considerable magical powers to manipulate those around them. This becomes critically important when the emerald eye discovers that killing its creator frees it from the creator\u2019s control but doesn\u2019t free it from the need to remain within 25 feet of some creature it is bound to. This is often the dead body of its creator if no other creature is available.  \n**Shifting Goals.** An emerald eye\u2019s motivations change over time. One may be purposeful, using its powers to drive its bound creature toward some specific goal. Another might feign cooperativeness, offering to share its defensive abilities in exchange for the creature\u2019s mobility. Still another might be a manipulative trickster, pretending to be an ioun stone, floating in circles around an ally\u2019s or victim\u2019s head while sparkling brightly to inspire jealousy and theft among its viewers.  \nSmaller than a clenched fist, an emerald eye weighs at most half a pound.  \n**Constructed Nature.** An emerald eye doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Emperor\u2019s Hyena: A choking cackle escapes the throat of the hyena. As it steps forward, patches of fur fall off of it, revealing bone and rotting muscle._  \nAs their name implies, emperor\u2019s hyenas are undead hyenas that have been magically enhanced and tied to the emperor. With rotting, matted fur, missing teeth, and baleful yellow eyes, they are easily mistaken for simple undead beasts. Their appearance belies a relentless cunning.  \n**Gifts from the God of Death.** The method of creation of emperor\u2019s hyenas was a gift given directly to the emperor by the god of death and has been entrusted to only a few necromancers. Emperor\u2019s hyenas can be created only from hyenas that were anointed protectors of the god\u2019s holy places when they were alive. Their scarcity means they are primarily used as messengers and guardians for the emperor. The emperor rarely sends them to attack enemies unless the enemy has truly angered him. The emperor is seldom seen without a pair of emperor\u2019s hyenas by his side. When he moves publicly, every available emperor\u2019s hyena is deployed to ensure his safety.  \n**Voice of the Emperor.** Emperor\u2019s hyenas often deliver messages when the emperor needs a messenger hardier than a Open Game License",
    "Empty Cloak: _Dark cloth of black and purple, stitched with silver and golden threads, this resembles a garment of elvish make. Smoke sometimes billows under the hood._  \n**Silent Motion.** A billowing empty cloak glides through the air, either under its own power or on the shoulders of its master. Its movement appears odd somehow, as though it moves slightly out of step with the frame bearing it.  \n**Guards.** Created by the shadow fey as unobtrusive guardians, empty cloaks are often paired with animated armor such as a monolith footman, and made to look like a display piece.  \n**Shadow Servants.** Shadow fey nobles sometimes wear an empty cloak as their own clothing; they use it to cover a hasty retreat or to assist in a kidnapping.  \n**Constructed Nature.** An empty cloak doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Empusa: A monstrous woman with claws and hooves of shining copper, the creature stalks the roads and tracks between towns, seeking to kill and devour any who stumble across her path._  \n**Bane of Travelers.** Distant kin to lamias, the dreadful empusae are exclusively female. They use their supernatural abilities to hunt down and devour the flesh of those traveling along deserted roads and byways between settlements. While empusae aren\u2019t afraid of sunlight, they tend to hunt at night, returning to caves and ruins during the day to feast on those they have killed. When travelers aren\u2019t available, empusae target shepherds and farmers, disguising themselves as goats or donkeys to get close to their targets.  \n**Copper Hooves.** The legs and hooves of an empusa are extremely powerful and are sheathed in magically-hardened copper, allowing her to deliver swift and powerful kicks and move at great speed. This copper can be harvested when the empusa is slain and is often used in the construction of magical boots and staffs.",
    "Eonic Drifter: _The air crackles and lights flicker in the ruins. In a whirl of colorful robes, the drifter materializes from the unfathomable maelstroms of time. His eyes scan the hall in panic, anticipating the terrible revelations of yet another era._  \n**Adrift in Time.** Not much is known about the time traveling eonic drifters other than that they left a dying civilization to look for help not available in their own age. To their misfortune, returning to their own time proved much more difficult than leaving it, so the eonic drifters found themselves adrift in the river of time. As the decades passed, their chance of returning home withered, along with the flesh of their bodies. They have been become mummified by the passing ages.  \n**Crystal Belts.** A drifter carries an odd assembly of gear gathered in countless centuries, proof of its tragic journey. The more eclectic the collection, the more jumps it has performed on its odyssey.  \nBelts of crystals around its body store the energy that fuels a drifter\u2019s travels. After each large jump through time, the reservoirs are exhausted and can be used only for very short jumps.  \n**Jittery and Paranoid.** Visiting countless eras in which mankind has all but forgotten this once-great civilization has robbed most eonic drifters of their sanity. Their greatest fear is being robbed of their crystal belts. They plead or fight for them as if their lives depended on them\u2014which, in a sense, they do. Adventurers who convince a drifter of their good intentions may be asked for aid. In exchange, a drifter can offer long-lost artifacts gathered from many forays through time.  \nDrifters can appear at any time or place, but they often frequent the sites of their people\u2019s past (or future) cities. There they are comforted by knowing that they\u2019re at least in the right place, if not the right time.",
    "Eonic Savant: A jagged blue scar of magical energy forms in the air, and a blue-robed figure steps out a moment later. As it moves, echoes of it appear to move a split second before and after it. The creature focuses its attention and the echoes solidify around it, one wielding the creature\u2019s staff, the other a spell._  \nThe eonic savant is an Open Game License",
    "Erina Defender: _This small humanoid has a slightly pointed face with bright, brown eyes and a black, snout-like nose. Its skin is covered in short, tan fur, and its head, shoulders, and back have smoothed-down quills._  \nErinas, or hedgehog folk, are a small, communal race.  \n_**Burrowed Villages.**_ Natural diggers at heart, erinas live in shallow networks of tunnels and chambers they excavate themselves. Enemies who attack the peaceful erinas easily become confused and lost in the mazelike tunnels. On their own ground, the erinas can easily evade, outmaneuver, or surround invaders. They often lure them onto choke points where the enemy can be delayed endlessly while noncombatants and valuables are hustled to safety through other tunnels.  \n_**Scroungers and Gatherers.**_ Erinas are naturally curious. They tend to explore an area by tunneling beneath it and popping up at interesting points. They dislike farming, but subsist mainly on the bounty of the land surrounding their homes. In cities, they still subsist on what they can find, and they have a knack for finding whatever they need. Sometimes they are called thieves, but they aren\u2019t greedy or malicious. They take only what they need, and seldom take anything from the poor. Some humans even consider it lucky to have a family of erinas nearby.  \nAs the largest and hardiest of their kind, erina defenders take the defense of their home tunnels very seriously, and are quite suspicious of outsiders. Once an outsider proves himself a friend, they warm considerably, but until then defenders are quite spiky.",

    "Eye Golem: _An eye golem is muscular giant, well-proportioned with smooth, marble-white skin covered in eye-like sigils. When it opens one of its eyes opens for a moment, a beam as bright as the sun shines forth, piercing the darkness._  \n**Covered in Arcana.** Eye golems stand at least ten feet tall, and their magically durable hide is covered with real eyes as well as arcane sigils that resemble eyes.  \n**Blinds Victims.** An eye golem rarely kills its victims, but leaves them blinded, wandering and tormented, seeing only visions of the eye golem flashing through their memory. This drives some mad while others instead choose to serve the golem, becoming devoted to the one who still holds sight.  \n**All Eyes Open.** When killed, an eye golem does not simply fall down dead. All of its eyes open at once, a deafening bellow is heard for miles, and a blinding burst of light shines from the body. When the light and noise stop, hundreds of perfectly preserved eyeballs are left on the ground, still warm and fresh and without scars or damage. Thin beams of arcane energy connecting the eyes to their owners can be detected with a successful DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Those who wield the central eye once the golem is slain can use it to restore stolen eyes to their victims.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Fabricator: A rectangular slab of thick, green ooze flows slowly across the floor. Twisting metallic veins and strange lights illuminate its translucent interior, and everything it touches dissolves into a formless sludge._  \n**Artificial Oozes.** Though fabricators superficially resemble monsters like ochre jellies or gelatinous cubes, they are in fact a type of construct composed of millions of minute constructs connected by an intelligent hive-mind. Most fabricators were built to aid in the construction of advanced machinery or structures and normally are not aggressive. However, their programming sometimes calls for the disposal of organic life, and they do not hesitate to apply fatal force when necessary.  \n**Relic of Past Empires.** The first fabricators were built by a cabal of ancient mages from a forgotten empire to construct a great weapon to use against their enemies. This weapon was completed and unleashed, subsequently dooming the creators and leaving the fabricators to carry on with the tasks assigned to them. Over time, the magical bonds to their masters\u2019 work slowly unraveled, freeing many fabricators from their responsibilities and leaving them without purpose. Today, some of these fabricators are employed by mage guilds to aid in the construction of magic items, communicating with the mages by etching words on sheets of copper.  \n**Construct Nature.** A fabricator doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Faceless Wanderer: The robed figure formed of tattered shadows and swirling darkness has a bone-white, featureless oval disk where its face should be._  \n**Corporeal Shadow.** Faceless wanderers are creatures made of solid darkness. They are spawned from the Void whenever the minds of a large group of sentient creatures are broken or twisted as a result of exposure to the Void or its denizens. The minds and memories of living creatures draw them to mortal realms.  \n**Memory Eater.** The faceless wanderers survive by stealing memories from sentient humanoids and create new faceless wanderers when they completely drain a humanoid of its memories. Curiously, faceless wanderers don\u2019t harm young humanoids and sometimes even aid them. Scholars speculate this odd behavior is because children possess fewer memories than adults.  \n**Void Traveler.** The faceless wanderer doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure.",

They do not look to kill victims, instead hoping to feed on distress for as long as possible.  \n**Relishing Manipulators.** Falsifier fogs are the souls of abusers and cult leaders who died collaborating with or benefitting from the manipulations of dark forces. Sometimes falsifier fogs form mutually beneficial relationships, willingly cooperating with evil spellcasters to spread misery. Open Game License",
    "Fane Spirit: As the sun gently dips below the horizon, the priest undergoes a startling transformation, his benevolent form replaced by the ghastly countenance of death._  \n**Temple Ghosts.** When a lawful individual dies defending a place of worship such as a temple, shrine, or other holy site, it sometimes rises as a fane spirit bound to the site, protecting it even in death. Most fane spirits were formerly clerics, though druids, paladins, and even lay worshippers can become fane spirits under the right circumstances. Fane spirits are lawful and typically only attack those who discover their undead nature or who try to harm their place of worship.  \n**Welcoming Priests.** During daylight hours, fane spirits appear to be living creatures, carrying on the same tasks they did when they were alive. Normal methods for detecting undead creatures do not work on them, and, unless attacked or injured, they show no outward signs of their true nature. This deception extends to the fane spirit itself, as it does not have any recollection of dying or of its time in its undead form. When this deception is revealed, the fane spirit becomes enraged with suffering and lashes out at those who made it remember.  \n**Undead Nature.** The fane spirit doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

They often ride woodland creatures, such as dire weasels or snowy owls._  \nHunters & Herders. The far darrig were the hunters, herders, and equerry of the elven nobility\u2014some still serve in this capacity in planes where the elves rule. Some stayed behind after the many of the fey retreated to wilder lands in the face of expanding human kingdoms.  \nFar darrig carry glaives made from fey antlers; each remains enchanted only as long as a far darrig holds it. Their leaders ride on fey elk the color of foxes, with gleaming green eyes; it is believed that their antlers are the ones used to make far darrig antler glaives.  \n**Hate Arcanists.** While not inherently evil, far darrig are hostile to all humans and will often attack human wizards, warlocks, and sorcerers on sight. If they can be moved to a friendly attitude through Persuasion or a charm spell or effect, they make very good guides, scouts, and hunters.  \n**Serve Hags and Worse.** They are sometimes found as thralls or scouts serving hags, trollkin, and shadow fey, but they are unwilling and distrustful allies at best.",

The lady voices her desire, and the attendant leaps into action, calling a phantasmal charger made of midnight and shadow._  \n**Fey Stewards.** The far dorocha manage the servants of the fey courts and, when tasked, carry out the more sinister biddings of their masters. Fey lords and ladies prize the far dorocha for their attention to detail and composed mien.  \n**Abductor of Mortals.** Sometimes called the \u201cdark man\u201d or \u201cfear dorcha,\u201d these malicious fey are described in grim folk tales.

    "Fate Eater: _These human-sized parasites resemble ghostly centipedes surrounded in erratic violet radiance. Their flesh is translucent and their jaws are crystalline\u2014they are clearly creatures of strange planes indeed._  \n**Destiny Destroyers.** Fate eaters infest remote areas of the planes, where they consume the threads of Fate itself. The Norns view them as vermin and sometimes engage particularly canny planar travelers either to hunt them or to help repair the damage they have done. This can be a deadly job as the fate eaters consider the destiny of a mortal to be the tastiest of delicacies, rich in savory possibilities.  \n**Planar Gossips.** Fate eaters can and do trade information about various dooms, fates, and outcomes, but one must have something rich in destiny to trade\u2014or at least, juicy gossip about gods and demons.  \n**Visionary Flesh.** Eating the properly-prepared flesh of a fate eater grants insight into the fate of another.",
    "Fear Smith: _Apart from their taloned hands and blank face, fear smiths appear elven. While its mouth is closed, a fear smith\u2019s face is featureless save for rows of deep wrinkles. Opening the large mouth in the center of its face reveals long needlelike teeth surrounding a single massive eye._  \nKnown as a fiars\u00eddhe among themselves, fear smiths are servants of the Court of the Shadow Fey and similar dark fey courts of such as those of Queen Mab and the Snow Queen.  \n_**Icy-Cold Eyes.**_ Fear smiths often serve as torturers or are dispatched to demoralize the court\u2019s enemies. Their stare stops enemies cold, making it easy for heavily-armed warriors to trap and finish a foe.  \n_**Devour Fear.**_ As their nickname suggests, fear smiths feed off strong emotions, and their favorite meal is terror. The fey prefer prolonging the death of victims, and, when free to indulge, a fear smith stalks its victim for days before attacking, hinting at its presence to build dread.  \n_**Hoods and Masks.**_ Fear smiths favor fine clothing and high fashion, donning hooded cloaks or masks when discretion is required. Eerily well-mannered and respectful, fear smiths enjoy feigning civility and playing the part of nobility, speaking genteelly but with a thick, unidentifiable accent from within a cowl.",
    "Felid Dragon: The tiger rises from its slumber, stretching its draconic wings. Light glints off its backswept horns as it roars its deafening challenge at intruders._  \n**Treasure Hoard.** Similar to other dragons, felid dragons are treasure hoarders with an eye for shiny and sparkly things. They sometimes align themselves with those who are trying to do good in the world, though their motivation is typically selfish and focused on obtaining treasure.  \n**Curious and Playful.** Like most cats, felid dragons are naturally curious and often put themselves in danger just to learn more about the world. They like to play with their prey, allowing it to live a little longer than necessary before knocking it down again for their own entertainment. This behavior is unavoidably instinctual and even the most austere felid dragons succumb to it.",
    "Fellforged: _A darkly foreboding intelligence glows behind this automaton\u2019s eyes, and its joints seep hissing green vapors._  \n**Wraith Constructs.** Fellforged are the castoffs of gearforged and clockworks production, given foul sentience when the construct bodies attract wraiths yearning to feel the corporeal world. The clockwork bodies trap the wraiths, which dulls many of their supernatural abilities but gives them physical form. The wraiths twist the bodies to their own use\u2014going so far as to destroy the body to harm the living.  \n**Soldiers for Vampires.** Fellforged commonly seek out greater undead as their masters. Vampires and liches are favorite leaders, but banshees and darakhul also make suitable commanders.  \n**Grave Speech.** The voice of the fellforged is echoing and sepulchral, a tomb voice that frightens animals and children.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A fellforged doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

She wears scaled armor, sea green like verdigris on copper, and wields a strange sword. Her pale eyes stare, unblinking._  \n**Undead Warlock Slaves.** Ancient and powerful beings across the multiverse grant magical knowledge to mortals through dangerous pacts. Those bound to these pacts become warlocks, but the will and force of their patron is borne by more than just those who strike bargains for sorcerous power. A fext is a former warlock who has become wholly dedicated to their patron\u2014mind, body, and soul\u2014and functions as enforcer, bodyguard, and assassin. They are powerful undead slaves to the will of their otherworldly patron.  \n**Linked to a Master.** Each fext is a unique servant of their patron and exhibits the physical traits of its master. The eyes of every fext are tied directly to their patron\u2019s mind, who can see what the fext sees at any time. The fext also possesses a telepathic link to its patron.  \nThe process a warlock undergoes to become a fext is horrendous. The warlock is emptied of whatever morality and humanity he or she had as wine from a jug, and the patron imbues the empty vessel with its corruption and unearthly will. Whatever life the fext led before is completely gone. They exist only to serve.  \n**Outdoing Rivals.** Scholars have debated about how many fext a patron can command. The more powerful and well-established have at least 100, while others have only a handful. Where there is more than one fext, however, they maneuverings amongst themselves to curry favor with their powerful lord. Each fext is bound to obey commands, but they attempt to carry them out to the detriment of their competitors. Scheming is common and rampant among them and they try to work without the aid of other fext as much as possible.  \n**Undead Nature.** A fext doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Fey Revenant: An amalgam of shadow fey and spider, the thorn-covered fey appears out of the shadows and envelops its victim in icy tendrils of darkness._  \n**Will of the Fey Queen.** Shadow fey who have proven themselves most loyal to the commands and desires of the fey courts catch the eye of the Queen. She calls them to her court and blesses them with a measure of her power.  \n**Fey Transformation.** A fey revenant retains the upper torso of its shadow fey body, its skin becomes thorny and bark-like, and its lower body changes into that of an arachnid or insect. Spiders, scorpions, and beetles are the most common, but many fey revenants have lower bodies resembling dragonflies, wasps, and locusts. Fey revenants with insect bodies that can fly have a flying speed of 30 feet.",
    "Feyward Tree: _Dark, bark-like rust encrusts the trunk of this cold-forged metal tree, and its dull metallic leaves rustle with the sound of sharp metal._  \n**Cold Iron Trees.** These ferrous constructs are cold-forged in a process taking several years, as bits of rust and other oxidation are cultivated one layer at a time into bark and branches. In this way, the artificers create massive, twisted trunks resembling real, gnarled trees. Green-tinged leaves of beaten cold iron are welded in place by the master craftsmen, and trained warmages bring the construct to life through intense magical rituals rumored to take a full turn of seasons.  \n**Fey Destroyers.** The tree unswervingly obeys the commands of its creators, guarding key points of entry across fey rivers and streams, abandoned sacred groves deep in the forest, suspected faerie rings, or possible elf encampments. Many are released deep in the deep elvish woods with orders to attack any fey on sight. These feyward trees are rarely, if ever, heard from again and whether they leave a bloody trail of flayed elves in their wake after rampages lasting for decades or some fey counter-measure neutralizes them is unknown.  \n**Growing Numbers.** Each year, the feywardens order their construction and release, trusting in the destructive nature of the constructs. A half-dozen might guard a single ring of toppled elven standing stones. The feywardens leave nothing to chance.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A feyward tree doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Fire Dancer Swarm: _A swirling mass of tiny, blue flames dances with the likeness of a skull embedded in each little, flickering fire._  \n_**Stunted Elementals.**_ Fire dancers are Tiny fire elementals. Speculation varies whether they\u2019re simply immature or somehow stunted. They may be castoffs from larger, fiery elemental beings. A single, solitary fire dancer is no more than a semi-sentient spark with a fragment of life and lofty but unrealistic ambitions. In large numbers, they\u2019re a menace.  \n_**Unite and Grow Strong.**_ Larger fire elementals are usually sessile creatures, content merely to exist on their plane of origin. Fire dancers possess (and some argue are infected with) mortal qualities\u2014they seek to reach a greater potential, which smacks of envy, ambition, and resentment. They realize that there is power in numbers and that, when united, they are a force to be reckoned with. A single fire dancer is no more threatening than a tiny candle flame, burning hot and blue. When thousands join together, though, the result is an inferno. The likeness of a skull in its flame is an illusion created by the creature, based on how the fire dancers perceive mortal creatures after they\u2019re done with them.  \n_**Surly Servants.**_ Lone fire dancers have individuality, but in groups, they develop a hive mentality. While this allows them to function as a swarm, it also makes them vulnerable as a group to mind-affecting magic. Savvy bards, conjurers, and enchanters who summon swarms of fire dancers know they must maintain a tight control on the swarm, for these creatures are surly servants at the best of times.  \n_**Elemental Nature.**_ A swarm of fire dancers doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Fire-Infused Water Elemental: A pillar of water rises up into a humanoid shape, steam trailing from its boiling form._  \n**Boiling Water.** Fire-infused water elementals are created when water elementals spend great lengths of time in superheated water, such as the borderlands between the Elemental Planes of Fire and Water, or when they are inundated with large amounts of fire magic. The elementals are irreparably changed and exist in a state between fire and water elemental. Too fiery for one and too watery for the other, they often find their way to the Material Plane, where they can carve out their own territory.  \n**Geothermal Dwellers.** Fire-infused water elementals prefer to inhabit areas with water heated by geothermal activity, such as hot springs and geysers. They claim such locations as their homes and grow violent when creatures harm or pollute their claimed waters. Fire-infused water elementals get along well with Open Game License",
    "Firebird: _This proud bird struts like a peacock, made all the more majestic by its flaming fan of feathers, which shift through the color spectrum._  \n**Guides and Helpers.** Firebirds are welcome sights to those in need of warmth and safety. They primarily work at night or in underground areas, where their abilities are most needed. Friendly to all creatures, they become aggressive only upon witnessing obviously evil acts.  \nFirebirds enjoy working with good adventuring parties, providing light and healing, though their wanderlust prevents them from staying for long. Well-traveled parties may encounter the same firebird more than once, however.  \n**Redeemers.** Firebirds enjoy acting as reformers. They find mercenary creatures they perceive as potential \u201clight bringers\u201d to whom they grant boons in exchange for a geas to perform a specific good deed, in the hope such acts will redeem them.  \n**Magical Feathers.** Firebird feathers are prized throughout the mortal world; occasionally, the creatures bestow feathers upon those they favor. Firebirds also seed hidden locations with specialized feathers, which burst into full-grown firebirds after a year. As the creatures age, their feathers\u2019 light dims, but this occurs gradually, as the creatures live over 100 years. Firebirds stand three feet tall and weigh 20 lb.",
    "Firegeist: _Made of fiery smoke coalescing into a vaguely humanoid shape, a firegeist is little more than wisps of black smoke and spots of brighter flame._  \n**Elemental Echoes.** When a fire elemental meets its destruction in a particularly humiliating fashion while summoned away from its home plane, what returns is a firegeist. Malevolent and resentful, less than their former prideful selves, they exist for revenge.  \n**Indiscrimate Arsonists.** Firegeists are not adept at telling one humanoid from another, and so burning any similar creature will do, providing it is flammable. Brighter Light, Darker Smoke. A firegeist can shine brightly or be primarily smoky and dark, as it wishes. It always sheds a little light, like a hooded lantern.  \n**Elemental Nature.** A firegeist doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Firetamer: Firetamers are the elite elementalists of the fire elemental wardens, using their attunement to the primordial forces of the world to not just create fire, not just command it, but tame it to their will. A firetamer is nothing like the manic pyromancers; while the latter recklessly wields fire as a weapon, firetamers use their talent to protect others from fire\u2019s destructive power\u2014or to use that same power to destroy those who threaten their people. Firetamers are almost always accompanied by a salamander, a fire elemental, or a small herd of magma or smoke mephits.",
    "Flab Giant: _This obese, bell-shaped giant is blemished by ulcers, enlarged veins, and fungal rashes. Though it stumbles about on a pair of short, calloused legs, it moves its weight with dangerous potential, catching many foes off-guard._  \n**Great Girth.** Whether as a result of a centuriespast curse or a gradual adaptation to an easy-going existence, the flab giant (one of the shortest breeds of giant) is gigantic in width rather than height and almost comical in its simple life.  \nToo obese to effectively grasp weapons in its chubby fingers, a flab giant uses its great mass to deadly effect, overrunning or grabbing opponents and then sitting on them to crush them to death, swatting away missiles, and simply putting up with the damage of melee attacks until its victims stop struggling and it gets up to see if they\u2019re dead yet.  \n**Efficient Foragers.** Flab giants are the least active of giant types, spending most of their waking hours resting, napping, and sleeping, and only devote a short period each day to listlessly shuffling about, scrounging for food. Because a flab giant can eat practically anything, it doesn\u2019t have to roam far to find enough food to sustain its bulk, so it is rarely found far from its crude lair.  \n**Knotted Skins.** Flab giants wear only scraps of clothing made of loosely knotted skins, leaving most of their stretch-marked and discolored skin exposed. Favored pelts include bear and human. A flab giant stands eight to ten feet tall and weighs 1,000 to 1,500 pounds.",
    "Flame Dragon Wyrmling: _The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw._  \nThe flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. \u201cMay you be the fire\u2019s plaything\u201d is a curse often used by the foolish.  \n_**Taunting Others.**_ The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure\u2014direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler\u2019s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.  \n_**Malevolent Purpose.**_ The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon\u2019s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.  \n_**Fond of Souvenirs.**_ Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.  \nNothing is safe from a flame dragon\u2019s endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon\u2019s undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon\u2019s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.  \n\n## Flame Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nFlame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest instincts in their prey.  \nMany of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n* The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can\u2019t stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check.\n* A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary flame dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair.

    "Fleshdreg: A mass of disgorged plant material lies at the base of this fleshy tree. Hollowed out areas give the impression of a mouth and a pair of eyes._  \n**Disgusting Display.** At a distance, the fleshdreg\u2019s appearance is not quite so disturbing, but a close-up view invokes revulsion in many creatures. Their most unsettling aspect\u2014the constant spewing of plant material\u2014is due to a strange regenerative factor. The trees spontaneously generate plant material, which negatively interacts with their acidic interiors and causes them near-constant digestive discomfort. The fleshdregs can direct this acidified material as a spew, which temporarily suspends this continual production, but they are hesitant to do so except in extreme circumstances. If they lose too much acid or their acid somehow becomes neutralized, the pulpy material fills their innards, bloating them and eventually erupting through their skin.  \n**Friendly Trees.** Many intelligent creatures encountering fleshdregs judge them by their horrifying features, but the fleshdregs are amiable hosts. They understand that many creatures find them repulsive and react to hostility with calming words and a show of peace. Assuming they establish a friendly footing with visitors, they prove to be valuable sources of information about the surrounding territory. In some cases, fleshdregs volunteer to accompany their new acquaintances within a swamp, especially if the fleshdregs seek to relocate.  \n**Otherworldly Origins.** Scholars who have studied the strange trees conclude they derive from some foreign environment. They are split on whether the creatures come from beyond the stars or migrated from deep within the underworld. The scholars agree fleshdregs serve an environmental niche in their native habitat similar to trees and may be an otherworldly equivalent to Open Game License",

Flithidirs are creatures of contrasts\u2014loud and lively, yet prone to moments of calm wonder; bold and cocky, yet easily startled; able to sing with breathtaking beauty or confuse their foes with earsplitting noise.  \n**Shapeshifters.** Flithidirs are shapeshifters, able to change into birds or smaller humanoids, and they favor colorful clothes and adornments, even while shapeshifted. Relentlessly curious, flithidirs often take the form of a bird when they encounter strangers, quietly following and studying the creatures. If the strangers are deemed safe and intriguing, the flithidir approaches in a humanoid form to get better acquainted.  \n**Easily Bored.** Flithidirs tirelessly seek out new things. Some desire new experiences\u2014songs and stories, unusual foods, and sudden discoveries\u2014while others are more covetous, ceaselessly collecting objects they find interesting. Sometimes this greed manifests as a magpie-like desire for shiny things, but a flithidir is also just as likely to be fascinated by items of a certain shape, texture, or color. When a flithidir encounters someone who possesses a thing it wants, it may offer something in exchange\u2014 usually a splendid song or acrobatic display\u2014or it may simply request the item with great charm, reacting with frustration or rage if the object is denied to it.",

Cultists gather in the name of a dark god, powerful lich, or crazed madman, and forever bind themselves body and soul into a single evil being. Flutterflesh take recently severed limbs and fuse these new pieces to themselves in accordance with some unknowable aesthetic.  \n**Dilemma of Flesh.** The most horrifying thing about a flutterflesh, however, is its devious nature. A flutterflesh offers its prey the choice to either die or lose a limb.

They sail between worlds in peculiar ships with split, lateen-rigged masts and rigging that howls like the damned in high winds. They tend a few pyramids in the deep deserts and are said to befriend void dragons, heralds of darkness, and other servants of the void.  \n**A High Plateau.** Leng is a forbidding plateau surrounded by hills and peaks. Its greatest city is Sarkomand, a place which some claim has fallen into ruin, and which others claim to have visited in living memory.  \n**Love of Nets.** When in combat, the folk of Leng use nets woven from the silk of their racial enemies, the spiders of Leng.

Some druidic legends claim the fraughashar were born out of a winter so cold and cruel that the spirits of the river itself froze. Bardic tales claim that the fraughashar are a tribe of corrupted goblins, and that they were permanently disfigured during a botched attempt at summoning an ice devil.

A strange, writhing tentacle protrudes slightly from its gaping mouth._  \n**Unnatural Origin.** Centuries ago, an order of wizards, known as the Covenant of Infinum, found itself in need of slaves and descended upon a nearby human settlement. The order enslaved every villager and conducted magical experiments upon them in the wizards\u2019 remote mountain tower. The wizards were trying to create the perfect servitor race, using the villagers as a baser life form. The experiment failed spectacularly, unleashing a magical transformative wave upon the tower.

Gbahalis live solitary lives except during the fall, when males seek out females in their territory. Females lay eggs in the spring and guard the nest until the eggs hatch, but the young gbahali are abandoned to their own devices. Killing an adult gbahali is a sign of bravery and skill for plains hunters.  \n_**Sentries and Stragglers.**_ In combat, a gbahali relies on its chameleon power to ambush prey.

    "Gnarljak: _A gnarljak looks like a bear trap springs sprung to clacking life and ready to tear flesh apart._  \n**Hopping Motion.** All steel and springs, a gnarljak is easily mistaken for a simple bear trap when lying dormant. But once it starts hopping in pursuit of a target, it reveals its animated nature and its only motivation: destruction of living things.  \n**Endless Snapping.** Gnarljaks are mindless. They do not grow tired. They exist only to pull creatures to the ground and chew through them, then turn around and chew through them again.  \n**Defensive Traps.** Some try to use gnarljaks to guard treasures or booby-trap approaches to important locations, but their indiscriminate biting makes quite dangerous to their owners as well. Certain monsters such as redcaps and shadow fey use gnarljak\u2019s with some regularity, and gnomes are very fond of making them part of a standard tunnel defense.",
    "Gnoll Havoc Runner: _The runner is a mottled blur, a sprinting gnoll laughing as it runs, ax held high. It sprints past, its weapon flashing in the sun._  \nWith the bristly mane and spotted fur characteristic of all gnolls, havoc runners blend into their tribe. Only the canny glint in the eyes hints at the deadly difference before the havoc runner explodes into violence.  \n_**Blinding Raids.**_ Havoc runners are scouring storms across the trade routes that crisscross the tribe\u2019s territory. Like all gnolls, they are deadly in battle. Havoc runners incorporate another quality that makes them the envy of many raiders: they can tell at a glance which pieces of loot from a laden camel or wagon are the most valuable, without spending time rummaging, weighing, or evaluating. Their ability to strike into a caravan, seize the best items, and withdraw quickly is unparalleled.",
    "Goat-Man: _This hunched, man-like figure lurches with a strange, half-hopping gait. Tattered clothing hangs from its muscled shoulders, and its legs are those of a ram, ending in cloven hooves._  \n**Trespassers on the Rites.** The first of the goat-men was the victim of a powerful curse intended to punish him for spying on magical rites exclusive to the women of his tribe. Admiring the grotesque result, the Black Goat of the Woods With a Thousand Young adopted him as its servant, and ensured that all who committed the same taboo fell to the same curse, and thus into the Black Goat\u2019s service.  \n**Bleating Speech.** A goat-man\u2019s head is tusked, adorned with curling ram\u2019s horns, and its beard often drips with gore. Rows of transparent, needle-like teeth fill its mouth; these teeth are malformed and make clear speech impossible for goat-men, though they understand others\u2019 speech perfectly well.  \n**Serve Foul Cults.** Cultists of Shub-Niggurath or the Black Goat in good standing are sometimes granted the services of a goat-man. The creatures guard rituals sites, visit settlements to capture or purchase suitable sacrifices, and perform certain unspeakable acts with cult members to call forth ritual magic.",
    "Gorao-Ka: The wizened, doll-sized woman sits beside a small shrine of bonsai branches. She smiles and reaches into a full pouch, removing a gold coin. She passes the coin with an encouraging nod to the desperate-looking man kneeling before her._  \n**Small Gods of Substance.** Gorao-ka represent small fortunes of both a physical and spiritual nature. Their shrines can be erected anywhere, but they are commonly found in settlements and widely-traveled areas. Larger settlements have multiple shrines, sometimes one or more per neighborhood, each of which is associated with a different gorao-ka.  \n**Gentle and Benevolent.** Gorao-ka have a kind look for every person that crosses their path. Each of them has a burning desire to assist people, and they grieve on the occasions that they can\u2019t. The laws governing their kind forbid them from extending aid to someone that hasn\u2019t made an offering at their shrine, though a gorao-ka accepts almost anything in tribute.  \n**Thieves\u2019 Bane.** Despite their generous natures, gorao-ka have no pity for those who steal from them. Fools who steal from gorao-ka swiftly discover their money inexplicably vanished, and can end up destitute if they don\u2019t make reparations.  \n**Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesn\u2019t require food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Graknork: Towering over the frozen landscape, this immense saurian monstrosity possesses a terrifying shark-like head with a multitude of serrated teeth. The monster has three eyes: two soulless black pits and a third larger eye that glows with a freezing blue light._  \n**Terror of the North.** The legendary graknork is one of the most powerful monsters to roam the endless tundra and taiga of the north and is feared by all who live in the rugged and frozen expanses of the world. Only the largest white dragons surpass the graknork in size and strength, and lesser creatures give the monster a wide berth. Graknorks are mostly found on land but are reasonable swimmers. They have no problem taking to the water to pursue escaping prey or to hunt fishermen and even whales. Graknorks are solitary creatures and cannot stand the presence of their own kind, attacking and eating juvenile graknorks that cross their path. When they do mate, it is a destructive affair with the female uprooting dozens of trees to build her nest. A typical graknork is more than forty feet long, though even larger specimens have been sighted in the coldest regions of the world.  \n**Great Blue Eye.** While the graknork\u2019s raw physical prowess is justifiably feared, the aspect of its appearance that causes the greatest consternation is its great, freezing blue eye. Its eye is said to possess terrible and wondrous powers, including seeing through illusions, freezing souls outright, and causing everlasting blizzards. Most of these tales are mere fancy and hearsay spun by northern tribesmen, yet there is no denying that the graknork\u2019s central eye is a fearsome weapon.",
    "Graveyard Dragon: This draconic skeleton is surround by a nimbus of light, colored in such a way as to betray the undead creature\u2019s living origins._  \nGraveyard dragons form out of the remains of evil dragons killed as part of a cataclysm that claimed the lives of several dragons at the same time, or when their remains are exposed to heavy concentrations of necrotic energy.  \n**Vindictive Undead.** Graveyard dragons are vengeful, like many other intelligent undead, but they focus their retribution on the ones responsible for their deaths rather than on their own kind. In fact, these undead dragons have a strange sense of protectiveness of other dragons, particularly for the type of dragons they were when they were alive. This sometimes extends to non-evil dragons, but most good-aligned dragons view the existence of graveyard dragons with distaste.  \n**Intimidating Appearance.** Graveyard dragons are particularly appealing to powerful undead as guardians for their lairs. A graveyard dragon\u2019s skeletal appearance is often enough to scare away most adventurers and tomb robbers. Unlike a more traditional animated skeleton, however, the graveyard dragon is capable of handling the few tomb robbers foolhardy enough to face it.  \n**Undead Nature.** The graveyard dragon doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Gray Orc: The ground erupts into a scrambling flood of orcs, their pale skin decorated with swirls of black resin._  \nDwelling deep beneath the ground, gray orcs move in a dark world, only drawn toward the surface by their innate hatred of arcane defilement.  \n**Drawn to Magical Corruption.** Gray orcs are drawn to areas where magic is frequently used or locations marred by magical pollution. Scholars believe the orcs\u2019 ancestral home was ravaged by magic, cursing them and driving them deep beneath the surface. They believe this history fuels within the orcs a deep hatred for magic, especially magic that defiles the natural world. For their part, the orcs have neither confirmed nor denied this speculation, though few scholars have been brave enough to approach them about it. Whatever the case, gray orcs grow violent around magic and seek to snuff it out wherever they find it.  \n**Synchronized Tribes.** Gray orcs move and act as one, their training leading their actions to be so synchronized that they appear to think as one. When faced with a major threat or a large magical catastrophe, a group of gray orcs will erupt from the ground in unison to swarm over the source.",
    "Gray Thirster: _This dried-out body of a long dead traveler is still clad in the tattered remains of his clothes. Skin as dry as parchment clings to the bones that are clearly distinguishable underneath. A hoarse moaning emanates from the dry, cracked lips._  \n**Thirsting Undead.** The greatest danger to people traversing badlands and deserts is thirst, and even the best prepared can find themselves without water. The lucky ones die quickly, while those less fortunate linger in sun-addled torment for days. These souls sometimes rise from the sand as gray thirsters, driven to inflict the torment they suffered upon other travelers.  \n**Destroy Wells and Oases.** Gray thirsters destroy or foul sources of water and often lurk nearby to ambush those seeking clean water.  \n**Thirsting Caravan.** Though they hunt alone, in at least one case an entire caravan died of thirst and rose again as gray thirsters. Called the dust caravan, it prowls the deep desert accompanied by skinchanging gnolls, shrieking ghouls, and a mummy lord, building a strange nomadic army.  \n**Undead Nature.** A gray thirster doesn\u2019t require air, food, or sleep.",
    "Great Gray Owl: Great gray owls are stealthy predators, and the largest of the non-giant varieties of owls. Unlike other owls, great grays aren\u2019t territorial\u2014with the exception of females raising young\u2014and don\u2019t flush or spook when other creatures approach. Rather, they remain still on their low perches, often going overlooked.",
    "Greater Death Butterfly Swarm: _These enormous clouds of orange and green butterflies add a reek of putrefaction to the air, stirred by the flapping of their delicate wings._  \n**Demon-Haunted.** A death butterfly swarm results when a rare breed of carrion-eating butterflies, drawn to the stench of great decay, feeds on the corpse of a fiend, demon, or similar creature.  \n**Dizzying and Poisonous.** The colorful and chaotic flapping of the insects\u2019 wings blinds and staggers those in its path, allowing the swarm to necrotize more flesh from those it overruns. Attracted to rotting material, the swarm spreads a fast-acting, poison on its victims, creating carrion it can feed on immediately.  \n**Devour the Undead.** Undead creatures are not immune to a death butterfly swarm\u2019s poison, and a swarm can rot an undead creature\u2019s animating energies as easily as those of the living. Given the choice between an undead and living creature, a death butterfly swarm always attacks the undead. Such swarms find ghouls and vampires particularly appealing. Some good-aligned forces regard summoning these swarms as a necessary evil.",
    "Greater Ghast of Leng: The creature has a maddened expression on its almost featureless face. Its vaguely humanoid body is covered in lumpy, grayish-green skin, and its head sits on a long neck. Its long arms end in vicious claws, and it stands on sharp hooves._  \n**Leaders of Carnivores.** Open Game License",
    "Greater Lunarchidna: A four-armed, four-legged creature in the vague shape of a human\u2014but seemingly made of fine spider silk\u2014moves down a tree, slowly chanting the incantation of a spell in the pale light of the full moon._  \n**Made in Corrupt Forests.** Lunarchidnas are beings of moonlight and spider silk created in forests permeated by residual dark magic. When this magic coalesces on a spider web touched by the light of a full moon, the web animates. The web gains life and flies through the forest, gathering other webs until it collects enough silk to form a faceless, humanoid body, with four legs and four arms.  \n**Hatred of Elves.** Lunarchidnas hate elves and love to make the creatures suffer. They poison water sources, set fire to villages, and bait monsters into stampeding through elf communities. These aberrations especially enjoy stealing away elf children to use as bait to trap the adults that come to the rescue.  \n**Cyclical Power.** The lunarchidna\u2019s power is tied to the moon. When the skies are dark during a new moon, the lunarchidna becomes more shadow than living web. Its mental ability dulls, and it becomes barely more than a savage animal. When a full moon brightens the night, however, the lunarchidna becomes a conduit of lunar light and can channel that power through its body. Using its heightened intellect, it makes plans, writes notes, and plots from the safety of the trees where it makes its home. In the intermittent phases of the moon, the lunarchidna is a more than capable hunter, trapping and devouring prey it encounters while retaining enough knowledge of its plans and magic to further its goals in minor ways. The lunarchidna\u2019s statistics change cyclically as shown on the Lunarchidna Moon Phase table.  \n\n#### Lunarchidna Moon Phase\n\nMoon Phase\n\nStatistics\n\nDaytime, new, or crescent moon\n\nOpen Game License",
    "Greed Swarm: The sound of metal clinking against metal becomes a deafening cacophony as a swirling cloud of coins mindlessly hunts for more valuables to absorb into its ever-expanding mass._  \nLocated in densely-populated areas, the greed swarm is solely focused on increasing the size of its hovering collection of valuables. Able to differentiate between objects of value and worthless junk, the swarm stalks streets and sewers alike. Its movements are erratic; the cloud swells and contracts in quick succession, repositioning itself in jerky, stilted bursts of motion.//  \n**Bad Penny.** The swarm consists of normal, mundane valuables animated by a magical master coin. Often mistaken as a standard regional coin, this master coin is created in a dark ritual to serve as a vessel for pure, ceaseless avarice. If the master coin is destroyed or separated from the swarm, the remaining coins return to their normal inert state and fall to the ground.  \n**All that Glitters.** The master coin cannot exert its power without a large enough supply of valuables to control in close proximity. Bank and vault owners who fail to screen incoming coinage for latent magical properties may find themselves in need of adventurers to discreetly quell a storm of their accumulated wealth. Wishing wells and public fountains are also common homes for greed swarms.  \n**Construct Nature.** The greed swarm doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Grim Jester: _A skeletal cadaver bedecked in the motley attire of a fool capers about while making jokes that mock mortality._  \n**Amusing Death.** When a jester on his deathbed moves an evil death god to laughter, the fool sometimes gains a reprieve. becoming a grim jester, whose pranks serve to entertain the god of death. Their purpose is to bring an end to mortal lives in a gruesome, comic, and absurd manner. As long as such jesters keep the death god amused, their continued unlife is assured.  \n**Grisly Humor.** A grim jester\u2019s jokes are not funny to their victims, but they offer a grim finality in combat. A killing joke might be absurd, such as \u201cHere is your final pineapple soul, a parting gift, goodbye.\u201d or sheer braggadocio such as \u201cYour footwork is atrocious, and your spell\u2019s lost its focus, your party\u2019s no match for my hocus-pocus.\u201d Others might be high-flown, such as \u201cMortal, your time has come, the bell within your skull does ring, ding, dong, dead.\u201d Grim jesters are famous for grim, bitter mockery such as \u201cYour blood on fire, your heart pumps its last, show me now a hero\u2019s last gasp!\u201d or \u201cOdin\u2019s raven has come for you; the Valkyries were busy. You lose, mortal.\u201d  \nA grim jester\u2019s mockery rarely entertain the living\u2014but gods of death, chained angels, and demons find them quite amusing.  \n**Randomness.** Grim jesters often get their hands on wands of wonder and scrolls of chaos magic. Beware the grim jester with a deck of many things\u2014they are quite talented in pulling cards whose magic then applies to foes and spectators.  \n**Undead Nature.** A grim jester doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Grimmlet: A jagged shard of smoky translucent crystal, approximately the size and mass of a housecat, hovers silently across the field._  \n**Strange Families.** Grimmlets reproduce by creating near clones of themselves when injured by arcane energy, leading them to quickly gather in large familial swarms. Strangely, a grimmlet can only swarm with other grimmlets created from the same progenitor grimmlet, which leads the swarm. Not long after the swarm forms, it disperses, each grimmlet moving on to create new swarms through magic injury.  \n**Whispering Menace.** Grimmlets do not speak. In fact, they never communicate with other creatures via any known form of language or telepathy, though they do seem to understand creatures of the Void. Despite this, the air around a grimmlet mutters and whispers at all times in a foul-sounding invocation. When the creature uses its innate magic, these whispers rise in volume slightly, giving canny listeners a split-second warning that something, likely unpleasant, is about to occur.",
    "Grimmlet Swarm: Flowing over the landscape like a glass carpet, this mass of smoky crystalline shards moves in a manner most unnatural. Occasionally, a bolt of black or purple energy arcs between two or more of the shards in the swarm._",

When grove bears clash to defend territory or compete for mates, they engage in brutal wrestling matches, each attempting to pin the other until one bear loses its nerve and flees.",

    "Gug: _The gugs are giants of the underworld, long since banished into dark realms for their worship of the eldest and foulest gods._  \n**Underworld Godlings.** Gugs enjoy smashing and devouring lesser creatures, and their burbling and grunting speech displays a surprising and malign intelligence to those few who can understand it. Gugs are occasionally worshipped by tribes of derro, and their strange underworld cities are filled with filled with esoteric monoliths and constructs.  \n**Nocturnal Raiders.** While gugs are banished into the underworld in mortal realms, they regularly flout this prohibition by raiding the surface by night. They also spend much time in the Dreamlands and the Ethereal plane; some gug warlocks and sorcerers are said to travel the planes with entourages of fext or noctiny.  \n**Prey on Ghouls.** Gugs devour ghouls and darakhul as their preferred foodstuffs. When these are not available, they seem to prefer carrion and particular varieties of psychotropic mushrooms, as well as something that is best described as candied bats.",
    "Gulper Behemoth: The titanic eel-like creature has delicately dancing frills and flickers of phosphorescence just under its translucent skin. Its mouth opens impossibly wide as it surges forward._  \n**Deep Sea Lure.** The gulper behemoth lives in the waters of the remotest oceans. It lures sea dwellers to their deaths with dancing motes of light within its massive, ballooning gullet. Rumors abound that even a sharp pinprick will deflate the sea monster.  \n\n## Gulper Behemoth\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nThe gulper\u2019s lair is filled with brightly-colored and labyrinthine giant corals. Smaller, mutualistic predators swim throughout the lair, keeping it well protected.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the gulper behemoth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the gulper behemoth can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The gulper behemoth commands deep sea eels and plants to constrict a target it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n* The gulper behemoth commands plants and coral to shoot boiling water at up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn\u2019t grant resistance against this damage.",
    "Gypsosphinx: _With black wings and a body pale as alabaster, the vulture-beaked gypsosphinx is easy to identify. As powerful servants of the gods of death and the desert, their riddles and obsessions all hinge on death and carrion. Their eyes can spot prey miles away, and the distance they climb into the sky hides their enormous size._  \nThe pale gypsosphinx shines in the desert sun and stands out in underground tombs and caverns, yet it can conceal itself when it flies in moonlit clouds. Gypsosphinxes are found anywhere bodies are buried or left to rot, and they harvest corpses from battlefields of warring desert tribes.  \n_**Gossips and Riddlers.**_ Gypsosphinxes converse with intelligent undead, priests of death gods, and with other sphinxes, but they rarely gather among their own kind. They guard their territory jealously, typically claiming a necropolis as the heart of their region.  \nLike all sphinxes, gypsosphinxes enjoy riddles. They rely on magic to solve challenging riddles they can\u2019t solve on their own.  \n_**Night Flyers.**_ Unlike most of their cousins, gypsosphinxes are gifted fliers capable of diving steeply from the night sky to snatch carrion or a sleeping camel. The stroke of midnight has a special but unknown significance for the beasts.  \n_**Foretell Doom.**_ Occasionally, a paranoid noble seeks out a gypsosphinx and entreats the creature to reveal the time and place of his or her death, hoping to cheat fate. A gypsosphinx demands a high price for such a service, including payment in corpses of humans, unusual creatures, or near-extinct species. Even if paid, the gypsosphinx rarely honors its side of the bargain; instead, it turns its death magic against the supplicant, bringing about his or her death then and there.",

It wears a loose-fitting tunic and carries a clamshell in its long, spindly hands._  \n**Diplomatic Fey.** Haleshi are fey that act as intermediaries between fey who live on the land and those who live in oceans and rivers, settling disputes that arise between the two groups. Haleshi are impartial in their rulings and prefer to make decisions based on evidence rather than rumor and speculation. The job of an haleshi is a difficult one due to the chaotic and unpredictable nature of many fey, but they usually receive the backing of the fey lords, particularly the River King, whose court they frequent, and the Bear King, who admires their stoic adherence to duty in the face of adversity.  \n**Clam Riders.** Haleshi have a mystical connection with ordinary clams and similar mollusks and are able to use mollusks to magically transport themselves from one body of water to another.  \n**Food-Lovers.** While haleshi have little to do with humanoids in their role as fey diplomats and judges, they have a predilection for human and elven cuisine, particularly desserts such as apple pies and strawberry tartlets.

They are cursed, becoming fiends hungering for the flesh and blood of the innocent.  \n**Mistaken for Undead.** Hantu penanggal are often mistaken for undead and don\u2019t correct this error, finding delight in taking advantage of adventurers ill-prepared for an encounter with a fiend.",
    "Harbinger of Wrath: Twisting adamantine spikes topped with an array of demonic and bestial skulls form the vaguely humanoid creature. It makes a loud screeching sound as it crushes everything in its path._  \n**Engines of Decimation.** The harbinger of wrath is a construct of immense size and destructive potential. Just seeing a harbinger causes most creatures to flee in terror, and few are willing or able to face one in battle. Creatures allied with a harbinger must also fear its terrible wrath, as it is not against skewering its allies on its many spikes to rejuvenate itself in the heat of battle.  \n**Forged by Demons.** The first harbingers were created in vast demonic forges by a powerful demon prince to use against his enemies. Since then, the construction process has passed to other demon princes and evil gods that delight in devastation and mayhem.  \n**Construct Nature.** A harbinger doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

It serves as a familiar, protective spirit to nearby farmsteads or villages, so long as tribute is regularly paid to the haugbui. Traditional offerings may include pouring the first beer from a barrel, leaving portions of meals out overnight, sacrificing blood or livestock, or burying a portion of any income in the mound. A freshly-woken haugbui devours the remains of creatures it was buried with, such as a hawk, hound, or horse.  \n**Milder Spirits.** Haugbuis are related to vaettir, but much older. They are more humble and less prone to taking umbrage, and indeed, a great many haugbui have long since forgotten their own names. They are not quick to spill blood when irritated, and thus are viewed with greater tolerance by the living.  \n**Scrye and Watch.** They prefer to watch over their people from within their mound, and only come forth over the most grievous insults or injuries. They can do a great deal from within their mounds thanks to their scrying ability.  \n**Undead Nature.** A haugbui doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Hebi-Doku: A serpent rises in tight coils, until its head is level with that of a tall man. Its body is thick and covered in glossy black scales broken by wide bands of bright orange. The two smaller serpents growing from its torso wind together and hiss menacingly. Twin rattles shake rapidly behind the creature._  \n**Ophidian Masters.** Shrines to hebi-doku are found most often in places where venomous snakes are common. They are also located in regions where snakes are considered sacred and in the homes and guilds of assassins who favor the use of toxins. Hebi-doku are never found without an accompaniment of other serpents.  \n**Feared and Placated.** Adventurers and archaeologists who travel through snake-filled jungles and ruins offer hebi-doku tribute, hoping that doing so will purchase some protection from the snakes they encounter. Scorned lovers sometimes venerate a local hebi-doku in the hopes that it will poison future relationships for their former paramour. A hebi-doku claims to care little for the veneration of non-serpents, but it knows it will cease to exist without their gifts.  \n**Toxic Shrines.** To summon a hebi-doku, a heart stilled by snake venom must be laid at the foot of a low altar built of mongoose bones.  \n**Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesn\u2019t require food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Heggarna: The foul abomination wriggles about on multiple caterpillar-like claspers. It has the jagged, circular maw and slippery body of an oversized leech and the head and coloration of a fierce tiger._  \n**Night Terrors.** Many sleepers have experienced nightmares in which a shadowy creature was sitting on them, draining them of their vital essence. While most of these experiences are because of some underlying psychological trauma, some are the result of visitations by terrifying creatures of the night. One such creature is the heggarna, a vile aberration that feeds on a creature\u2019s mental energy as it sleeps and infuses the victim\u2019s subconscious with terrible nightmares for its own vile amusement.  \n**Hidden Fear.** During the day, the heggarna disguises itself as a stray cat, lurking near the homes of potential prey and fleeing with feline-like caution when anyone comes near. Most humanoids overlook simple animals like cats when dealing with a heggarna infestation, but magic can detect the creature\u2019s true appearance. Normal animals react to the heggarna with a strange ferocity, which experienced hunters recognize as a sign of a heggarna.",
    "Helashruu: An enormous looking glass floats forward, its enormous, warped frame composed of writhing purple tendrils, and its surface covered in dozens of hideous, swirling eyes. Several razor-sharp whips whirl through the air around it._  \n**Mirrors from Beyond.** The helashruu are bizarre and terrifying aberrations that travel the planes, spreading chaos and destruction. Resembling towering mirrors covered in tentacles and eyes, helashruu defy rational explanation. When they deem it necessary to communicate with other creatures, it is usually through a jumbled mishmash of thoughts with their telepathy, though making sense of what they say is often next to impossible.  \n**Trapping Gone Astray.** Sages versed in planar lore believe the helashruu were created when a mirror of life trapping swallowed a powerful, deity of chaos and shattered under the strain of the energies it tried to contain. The pieces then scattered across the planes before forming into the first helashruu. The helashruu sometimes trap creatures within themselves, giving credence to this belief. Some sages hypothesize that if all the helashruu were to gather together in one place, they would reform the original mirror, and the evil entity would be released from its confinement. Thankfully, these creatures are extremely rare and hold nothing but contempt for others of their own kind.",
    "Herald Of Blood: _The heralds of blood are 20-foot-tall giants with bruised purple skin, and wart-like blood blisters that deform their features. They often wear cowled robes over golden armor streaked with black or green, and their staves of power are always ebony and mithral, embedded with precious stones._  \nAs powerful sorcerers and blood mages, heralds of blood are without peer. They enjoy enslaving ogres and giants whenever possible, though they make do with lesser slaves when they must.  \n**Dark Prophets.** Their stirring speeches proclaim that the end times are fast approaching, and their followers must prepare for a bloody reckoning. Behind their charismatic preaching, the heralds of blood serve elder earth gods that demand blood sacrifices, especially dark druid orders devoted to human hunts and the murder of innocents. They have the power to grant strength, lust, and vitality\u2014or to wither those who cross them.  \n**Blood Magic Vortexes.** In their true form, which they keep hidden except in battle, heralds of blood are swirling vortexes of blood, bone, and raw magical power. They feed on ley line magic and the black blood of the earth as much as on flesh and blood.",

Speaking of this form is difficult, but poets and bards trying to describe it have said it resembles an apocalyptic horror built of chained souls and the slow death of children carried along in a glacial river, rushing to an inevitable doom.  \n**Sword and Cloak.** The black sword and star-scattered cloak of a herald of darkness are part of its magical substance and cannot be parted from it.

All the while, the butcher grows in stature and sprouts wicked horns as it revels in the massacre._  \nHeralds of slaughter are sent by dark gods to foment unrest and agitate mortals into committing barbaric atrocities.  \n**Provokers of Wrath.** Disguised as a trusted craftsman, a herald of slaughter finds a source of anger in a community and feeds it until it grows, all while pretending to understand and offer solutions to the source. A herald of slaughter fuels the anger of the people by instigating mass culling, revolts, and blood sacrifices. As problems escalate, a herald of slaughter reveals its fiendish form to culminate the savagery in a final, chaotic exaltation of the dark gods.  \n**Brutality and Blood.** Once a herald of slaughter has been revealed, it assumes its fiendish appearance and wades fanatically into combat.

    "Herald of the Void: The herald of the void portends the world\u2019s ruination by means of cold, fire, plague, war, or a magical apocalypse of another kind.

When it opens its crooked mouth, molten gold drips from its jaws._  \n**Avarice Personified.** Hoard drakes are perhaps the most avaricious and lazy of all dragonkind, spending their days lying on huge mounds of copper, silver, and gold pieces, rarely\u2014if ever\u2014venturing out of their lairs. Hoard drakes feed irregularly, gorging themselves on metals, minerals, and the occasional dwarf or goat when hunger finally gets the better of them. Hoard drakes are almost as vain as they are greedy and meticulously clean their scales to a polished gleam that matches their golden treasure. Hoard drakes lust after the hoards of true dragons and sometimes attack small dragons to steal their treasure or take over their lairs.  \n**Robbers Beware.** Strangely, hoard drakes are docile creatures that are open to conversation with visitors. However, hoard drakes are roused to terrible anger when even the smallest portion of their treasure is taken. At such times, a hoard drake leaves its lair to relentlessly pursue the thief, not resting until its treasure is reclaimed and the offending party is slain and eaten.

Despite their great physical and intellectual power, dragons are always suspicious of any creature willing to work for them. The first hoard golem was created when a dragon realized that there could be no guardian more trustworthy with its hoard than the hoard itself. Since then, the secret of hoard golem construction has emerged, and rich nobles have followed suit, enchanting their wealth to defend itself from thieves.  \n**Patient Homebodies.** As constructs, hoard golems are mindless, lying in wait for anyone other than their creator to come within striking distance. In the case of evil dragons, this may include the wyrmlings of dragon parents looking to establish dominance in the family. Hoard golems fight to the death, but they rarely leave the rooms they inhabit for fear that clever treasure hunters might trick the hoard into walking itself right out of the owner\u2019s den.  \n**Silent and Wealthy.** Hoard golems cannot speak. A hoard golem is 25 feet tall and weighs 20,000 lb.

The hodags gorge on as much food as possible and engage in mating rituals. When the week is over, the hodags disperse, returning to their territories.  \n**Impossible to Train.** Hodags are born with strong predator instincts, which helps the young survive after being left by their mothers. Many believe this same instinct makes hodags impossible to train, but such claims only make them more valuable targets for those who collect exotic pets.",

    "Isonade: _The isonade\u2019s gargantuan thrashing tail is lined with cruelly hooked barbs, and it delights in destruction. When it approaches a coastal village, its tail shoots high into the air from beneath the waves, and it smashes all ships, docks, and nets in its path._  \n**Coastal Destroyer.** The isonade is a beast of destruction, sweeping away entire islands and villages. It wrecks seaside communities with battering winds and carves coastlines with its powerful magic. Though not very intelligent, it singles out a community and tries to lure residents into the waves with its animal messenger ability, sending gulls bearing confused riddles, grand promises, and eerie noises to the townsfolk.  \n**Ocean Sacrifices.** When coastal villagers suffered from a hurricane or tsunami, they fell back on folklore and blamed the stirrings of the dreaded isonade. To some, appeasing a leviathan such as this makes sense. Some say that a degenerate group seeks to draw the beast forth by sailing from sight of land and dumping a long chain of bound and screaming sacrifices into the lightless depths of the sea.  \n**Enormous Age and Size.** The isonade is more than 45 feet long. The beast\u2019s age is unknown, and many coastal bards tell some version of the legend\u2014some believe it is the last of its kind, others believe that a small group of isonade remains.",
    "Jack of Strings: Clad in fine clothes of black and red, the tall, slim figure steps forward. With a clawed hand grasping a crossbar, it makes its eyeless marionette dance. A chuckle of cruel delight escapes its fanged maw as a nearby observer suddenly rises and spasmodically mimics the dance._  \n**Court Entertainers and Punishers.** A jack of strings uses its collection of marionettes to amuse shadow fey courts. It is adept at tailoring its performances to the crowd, switching effortlessly between charming plays, ribald performances, satirical pantomimes, and terrifying tales. During these performances, the jack of strings can take control of a creature in the audience to enact justice in the form of humiliation, torture, or even death. The jack is sometimes hired by fey nobility to enact such justice on rivals.  \n**Uncanny Valley.** The jack of strings takes control of its victims by establishing a link between the victim and one of its marionettes. When it establishes the link, the marionette becomes lifelike while the jack\u2019s victim takes on a wooden appearance. The puppet gains the victim\u2019s eyes, which disappear from the victim\u2019s face.  \n**Masters of Puppets.** Jacks of strings have several marionettes at their disposal. Aside from the first, which it painstakingly crafts itself, the jack\u2019s puppets derive from victims who perish while linked to the jack\u2019s puppet. Jacks harvest their prey in the mortal realm under the guise of a traveling entertainer and typically target people who won\u2019t be missed.",
    "Jaculus: _This small dragon has feathered wings on its forearms and powerful legs it uses to cling to trees._  \nThe jaculus (plural jaculi), is a draconic predator that roams the forest and jungle looking for valuable objects it can add to its hoard. Also called the javelin snake, a jaculus loves shiny or reflective items, and it is clever enough to identify items of real value. It will fight and kill to take items it desires, which it stashes inside hollow trees far from any forest trail.  \n**Leapers.** Jaculi are far better jumpers than flyers. They can jump 18 feet horizontally or 12 feet vertically after taking a single 2-foot step. They even climb faster than they fly, so they use their wings to flap clumsily back into the trees only when necessary.  \n**Teamwork Thievery.** Jaculi are among the least intelligent of the dragons\u2014but they\u2019re still smarter than most humans, and they\u2019re known to pursue cunning and complicated plots to build their hoards. Many traditional tales tell of jaculi in the southern forests working as teams to separate merchants and other travelers from their wealth, figuring out ways to abscond with gems and jewelry before the owners even know they\u2019ve been robbed. Some jaculi may feign docility or even pretend to be friendly and helpful, but wise travelers know that the creatures drop such ruses as soon as they can steal what they\u2019re really after.",
    "J'ba Fofi Spider: _A large, brown spider that resembles a tarantula with exaggeratedly long legs gracefully emerges from the bushes, followed by similar arachnids that are smaller and yellow in color._  \nThe j\u2019ba fofi resembles an oversized tarantula with very long legs, although a flicker of intelligence indicates this species evolved above mere vermin.  \n**Spider Pack Leaders.** The youngest are yellow in color, but their hairs turn brown as they age. Immature j\u2019ba fofi pull ordinary spiders into their fellowship in teeming masses that follow along wherever they roam.  \n**Fond of Camouflage.** The natural coloring of a j\u2019ba fofi, along with its proficiency at camouflage\u2014their hair-like bristles are usually covered in a layer of leaves\u2014makes it virtually invisible in its natural environment. They weave leaves and other forest litter into their webs to create well-hidden, enclosed lairs.",
    "Jotun Giant: _The earth shudders with every footfall of a Jotun giant, the immortal enemies of the gods. Tall enough to look a titan in the eye and strong enough to wrestle a linnorm, Jotun gaints are the lords of giantkind. Their enormous halls are carved in mountains and glaciers throughout the frozen wastes._  \n**Foes of the Gods.** As foes of the northern gods, they plot to regain their former status as lords of Creation. Many know ancient secrets and snippets of antediluvian arcane lore, and so may have abilities beyond those listed below. More powerful Jotun giants straddle the line between mortal and demigod.  \n**Contests and Challenges.** Like many giants, the Jotun enjoy a challenge, even from tiny little humans. Only the mightiest heroes can challenge a Jotun giant\u2019s might in physical combat. Using cunning or trickery is a safer bet\u2014though being too cunning is also angers them, and Jotun giants are no fools.  \n**Seekers of Ragnarok.** The Jotun giants know great magic, and strive to bring about end times of Ragnarok.",
    "Kachlian: This floating creature has numerous writhing tentacles protruding from a body that is hidden inside an enormous shell. The colors of its body shift slowly between grays, greens, and even deep purples._  \n**Otherborn.** Kachlians form in the space between spaces, birthed where madness prevails. They find their way to the darkened caverns beneath the ground through portals of chaos and darkness\u2014breaches in the fabric of reality caused by concentrations of turmoil, despair, and insanity. They are no strangers to the plateaus of Leng, and its denizens give wandering kachlians a wide berth.  \n**Eater of Souls.** The kachlian consumes the souls of creatures, preferring intelligent and enlightened prey. When it consumes a creature, the creature\u2019s soul is torn to pieces. The kachlian absorbs the parts it considers valuable into its own being and discards the rest. These partial souls often combine into a twisted amalgam of spirits called a Open Game License",
    "Kalke: _Combining the head of a goat and the body of a monkey makes the creature odd enough; combining the social grace of a baboon with pretensions of a scholar makes it more comical than threatening._  \nFiendish pests that infest derelict wizards\u2019 towers and laboratories, the kalkes are either the by-product of botched gates into the lower realms or the personification of an evil deity\u2019s contempt for wizards. All kalkes act with the arrogance of magi while having the social characteristics of baboons. Being of fiendish blood, kalkes do not age and require neither food nor drink. Though lacking any formal spellcasting ability, all kalkes can produce magical effects through the dramatic mumming of largely spontaneous and unstudied rituals.  \n**Hoard Magical Paraphernalia.** The drive to produce ever more fanciful rituals gives a kalke the compulsion to accumulate spell components, magical foci, and other occult paraphernalia. Although these objects serve no purpose, the kalkes seek out spellcasters in their vicinity and steal any paraphernalia they can find. Because they have no ability to distinguish what\u2019s magically useful from what isn\u2019t, they grab any jewelry, pouches, sticks, or ornate objects they uncover. Sometimes children, animals, or other small humanoids are taken to be used as sacrifices, if they can be easily carried away.  \n**Perform Rituals.** Troops of kalkes inhabit trees, caverns, and ruins around sites of significant magical activity. Twice a month, or more during major astrological and seasonal events, the kalkes gather to perform\u2014by way of dance, chant, and sacrifice\u2014an imagined rite of great magic. The effort has an equal chance of achieving nothing whatsoever, causing dangerous but short-lived misfortunes (snakes raining on the countryside, creatures summoned from the lower planes), or triggering calamities (great fires or floods).  \nAn additional side effect of these rituals is that the troop may gain or lose members magically. If the troop numbers less than 13, a new kalke appears as if from nowhere; if it contains 13 or more members, then 3d4 of them find themselves mysteriously gated to the nearest location of magical activity\u2014often hundreds of miles away. Those teleported arrive in a state of hysteria, with individuals extinguishing flames, grabbing frippery, and running in all directions. Because kalkes have no control over their displacement, it\u2019s not surprising to find them in abandoned dungeons or keeps, clutching the property of some long-lost wizard.  \n**Hagglers.** The kalkes will return the goods they've taken, in exchange for a ransom or fee. These exchanges need to have the outward appearance of being impressively in the kalke\u2019s favor. A particularly generous (or devious) spellcaster may be able to reach an accommodation with a persistent local troop of kalkes.",

Its eyeless head is bulbous, with an elongated mouth that is almost snout-like._  \n**Allies of the Ghasts of Leng.** The kaveph are massive creatures that originate from the lightless underground of the  \n**Plateau of Leng.** They are usually found in the company of the Open Game License",
    "Keelbreaker Crab: Three figureheads rise from the tattered sails and anchor chain that drape the crab\u2019s carapace. As the behemoth clacks its claws, the maidens depicted on the figureheads begin to wail._  \nFew monsters strike more fear into the hearts of sailors than the keelbreaker crab. These enormous crustaceans prey on ships caught in shallow water and decorate their shells with the wreckage left behind. Keelbreaker crabs are drawn to ships carrying magical cargo, as well as to the enchanted, living figureheads that often adorn such vessels.  \n**Living Figureheads.** The wails of a keelbreaker\u2019s figureheads drive most who hear them mad. However, a figurehead recovered intact from a crab might be convinced to reveal the location of a hidden treasure or even chart a course to the native harbor of the ship it formerly adorned.",
    "Kelp Drake: The dragon surges through the water in a rippling mass of seaweed, flotsam, and hungry jaws._  \n**Avarice and Opportunity.** Scavengers driven by draconic instinct, kelp drakes have an eye for sunken treasure and easy food. They favor giant oysters, shipwrecked sailors, and unperceptive castaways. Never in one place for long, kelp drakes keep their hoards with them, bundled up in seaweed and scum. Tragically, they lack the intelligence to tell the difference between genuine treasure and pretty but worthless objects.  \n**Drawn to Disaster.** Kelp drakes instinctively trail along the wakes of larger oceanic creatures. After powerful monsters like Open Game License",
    "Kelp Eel: A thick, snakelike creature made of thousands of blades of kelp rises above the water\u2019s surface. Flyaway blades swirl from the primary mass as the creature winds itself around its hapless prey._  \nKelp eels were accidentally created by merfolk arcanists who desired to protect their community from the myriad threats facing them. They attempted to bring the kelp forests near their settlement to life to entangle attackers, slowing them long enough to allow the merfolk to repel them. Instead, the first kelp eels were born as the blades of kelp wove themselves into massive eely forms that ravaged the very community they were created to protect.  \n**Serpents of the Shallows.** Since their creation, kelp eels have spread across the ocean. Forests of sentient kelp grow in ocean shallows, scarcely different to the casual observer from any other marine jungle. As the kelp matures, the blades wind around the thallus and eventually detach from its holdfast as a full-grown kelp eel. The kelp eel then moves on to an unclaimed shallow and attempts to create a new forest.  \n**Mariners\u2019 Nightmares.** The presence of a kelp eel is a blight upon people whose livelihoods depend on the ocean. The voracious eels are known to overturn boats and to drag their occupants to a watery grave. Kelp-entwined humanoid remains are common on the floor of kelp eel forests. Experienced sailors sometimes chum the waters as they approach a kelp forest, hoping to attract other large ocean predators to distract the local kelp eels.  \n**Deep Hunters.** While kelp eels live and breed in shallower waters, it isn\u2019t uncommon for them to hunt the ocean deeps if fertilizer is proving scarce near their forest. Knowledgeable mariners know that the presence of dead whales, sharks, and giant squid in shallow waters could be an indicator of kelp eel activity.",
    "Keyhole Dragonette: A wingless reptile with a long, lithe body and short, powerful legs scurries down an alley after a rat. Its pointed snout darts into the hole where its prey disappeared._  \nThe keyhole dragonette is a small, wingless dragon with flexible bands of large, overlapping scales, a pointed snout, and a wide, flat tail.  \n**Urban Exterminators.** Keyhole dragonettes were magically bred to be adept at entering closed-off or hard-to-reach places. Their original purpose was to seek out and destroy nests of rats and other city-dwelling vermin, but they regularly find themselves employed as living lockpicks. Their sensitivity to vibrations helps them find prey no matter where it is hidden, and their long, deft tongues enable them to pick even the most complex of locks. Dragonettes have difficulty delineating between pests and pets, and they sometimes consume the furry companions of the people whose homes they are ridding of vermin.  \n**Big Eaters.** Belying their small frames, keyhole dragonettes have voracious appetites and can consume a variety of foods. Aside from meat, they enjoy fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Keyhole dragonettes with easy access to sugary foods often develop a sweet tooth.  \n**Loyal Companions.** Guards, wilderness scouts, and rogues of all types often see the value in taking a keyhole dragonette as a companion. Young dragonettes are easy to train and eagerly bond with people, quickly becoming steadfast friends with their caretakers. If the person a dragonette has bonded to dies or leaves, the dragonette becomes despondent. The depression can last for years if something doesn\u2019t occur to lift the creature\u2019s spirits.",
    "Kezai: This creature looks much like a human-sized scorpion with wide, laced wings. The tip of its curled tail holds numerous barbs that drip sticky poison._  \n**Chemical Killing Machine.** The kezai is a creature that lives in hot climates and wages a chemical war on anything that opposes it. It emits a foul poison from its tail, coating the barbs that it hurls at enemies. If this wasn\u2019t deadly enough, it naturally produces a thin, flammable gas that it can ignite with a searing chemical produced in a gland near its mandibles. Fortunately for those who come across the kezai, the gland is slow-acting and takes time to produce the chemical necessary to ignite the gas.",
    "Khodumodumo: The hillock suddenly sprouts to life, rising up from its surroundings to reveal a sightless, toad-like monster with a cavernous maw. Six long red tongues emerge from this orifice, each as thick as a man\u2019s torso and ending in a razor-sharp point._  \n**The Hills Have Tongues.** The khodumodumo is one of the apex predators of the hills and badlands in which it lives, disguising itself as a moderately-sized hillock to lure creatures closer before animating and impaling them on one of its many tongues. While not evil, the khodumodumo is a voracious predator that constantly needs to eat, and it attempts to devour just about anything that comes within reach.  \n**Rite of Passage.** Slaying a khodumodumo in single combat is often considered a rite of passage for a fire giant seeking to contest the leadership of a clan, especially because the creature is naturally resistant to fire. Powerful red dragons have also been known to hunt khodumodumos for sport.",
    "Kikimora: _This strange-looking humanoid combines the features of an old crone and some manner of bird. A shawl covers her head but cannot contain her prominent beak and clawed hands. Her skirt reveals bird-like feet._  \n**Filthy Illusions.** Kikimoras are devious house spirits who torment those they live with unless they are catered to and cajoled. They delight in harassing homeowners with their illusions, making a house look much filthier than it actually is. Their favored illusions include mold, filth, and scuttling vermin.  \nThey love secretly breaking things or making such destruction seem like an accident. They then convince the house\u2019s residents to leave gifts as enticement for making repairs in the night.  \n**Brownie Hunters.** Kikimoras hate brownies. While brownies can be mischievous, kikimoras bring pain and frustration on their housemates instead of remaining hidden and helping chores along. Some brownies seek out kikimora\u2011infested homes with the intention of evicting them.  \nIf homeowners refuse to appease the kikimora (or cannot rid themselves of her devious presence), the kikimora sends a swarm of spiders, rats, or bats. Many times inhabitants in a home plagued by a kikimora believe it is haunted.  \n**Fast Talkers.** While they try to avoid notice and aren\u2019t great talespinners, kikimoras are convincing and use this influence to gain an upper hand\u2014or to evade capture or avoid violence.",

Though they\u2019re rare and solitary creatures, kirikari are considered highly dangerous due to their heightened aggression and territorial behavior.  \n**Ambush Predators.** Few can spot a kirikari in hiding, as it appears as little more than a collapsed tree concealed in fog. It then waits patiently for its prey to draw near\u2014before striking out at them with its lightning-fast bite.  \n**Symbiotic Relationship.** The mist that covers a kirikari\u2019s body comes from a unique type of mold that adheres to its carapace. The mold secretes an acid that evaporates harmlessly shortly after being exposed to air. The kirikari uses this mist to conceal itself and disorient its prey. Despite being natural-born swimmers, kirikari tend to avoid swimming in ocean waters, as exposure to salt quickly kills its mold.  \n**Wyvern Hunters.** Though unusual for its behavior, kirikari have been known to travel incredible distances to hunt down wyverns. Some scholars theorize that the toxins within a wyvern\u2019s body are a necessary component in the maintenance of a kirikari\u2019s mold.",

Beneath his ruined tabard, swirling runes and sigils dance across an impossibly muscular frame._  \nOnce ordinary warriors, these towering behemoths have been scourged by wild and unpredictable magic that lingers in forgotten and forbidden parts of the world.  \n**Revised Beyond Recognition.** Perhaps a paladin claims a trophy from an ancient and unknowable force from beyond the stars, after routing a dungeon of its followers\u2014 and slowly, the trophy changes him. In the heat of combat, a simple swordsman might quaff the wrong potion and be spontaneously transformed by an errant wizard\u2019s experimental brew. Whatever their origins, they now walk the world as hulking abominations, gifted strength unimaginable in an ironic reflection of their former selves.  \n**Born of Boons.** Although many knights ab-errant may be altered after exposure to unpredictable arcane sorcery, some were created by divine magic. These may be devotees of trickster gods, or ones that are especially cruel, or they may have prayed to innocuous deities in ways that were unorthodox or otherwise wanting.",
    "Kobold Alchemist: More than anything, kobolds are survivors. Their scaly skin and keen night vision as well as their dextrous claws and sensitive snouts make them quick to sense danger, and their clawed feet move them out of danger with cowardly speed. They are small but fierce when fighting on their own terms, and their weight of numbers helps them survive in places where larger but less numerous races can\u2019t sustain a settlement.

An acrid reek follows in the creature\u2019s wake._  \nKobold alchemists are usually smelled before they are seen, thanks to the apothecary\u2019s store of chemicals and poisons they carry. Alchemists often sport mottled and discolored scales and skin, caused by the caustic nature of their obsessions. They raid alchemy shops and magical laboratories to gather more material to fuel their reckless experiments.  \n_**Dangerous Assets.**_ Alchemists can be a great boon to their clan, but at a cost. Not only do the alchemists require rare, expensive, and often dangerous substances to ply their trade, they tend to be a little unhinged. Their experiments yield powerful weapons and defensive concoctions that can save many kobold lives, but the destruction caused by an experiment gone awry can be terrible.",

More gentle fey rightfully find the creatures to be a menace. A kot bayun measures six feet long and weighs over 200 lb. They are long-lived, and some stories record the same kot bayun in a region for over 400 years.  \n**Sing to Sleep.** In addition to their stealthy natures and physical prowess, kot bayun have the ability to put prey to sleep with song.

Unlike krakens and giant squid, krake spawn can scuttle onto land._  \n**Demonic Crossbreeds.** Some believe krake spawn are demonic crossbreeds created by the aboleth, fusing kraken blood with demonic souls. Others say that krake spawn are the horrible creation of a long-forgotten meddling god, summoned to the mortal world by deep ones. Certainly krake spawn do respond to summoning magic, and sorcerers do summon krake spawn through blood sacrifices to work evil in the world. However, they do so at considerable peril: unlike demons and devils, krake spawn are seldom bound by pacts of any kind.  \n**Outwit Humans.** Though enormous and carrying an armored green shell on their six spindly legs, krake spawn are surprisingly quick and agile. Worse, they have a malicious and bloodthirsty intellect. A krake spawn is considerably smarter than most humans, who mistake them for dumb beasts\u2014an error that can often prove fatal.  \n**Iceberg Fortresses.** Krake spawn live in remote, icy regions, where they fashion elaborate iceberg fortresses. When they venture into warmer climes in search of magic or slaves, they can preserve their icebergs with ice storms. These fortresses are stocked with frozen creatures (an emergency food supply), the krake spawn\u2019s treasure and library, slaves or prisoners of many races, and a hellish nest filled with the krake spawn\u2019s offspring.  \nA krake spawn measures 40 feet in length and weighs 2,000 lb.",
    "Lambent Witchfyre: A creature of pure blue fire trickles across the cavern floor, burning and devouring all except the stone._  \nThough its behavior is similar to oozes that infest subterranean areas, the lambent witchfyre is composed of living blue flame, not protoplasm. Like liquid fire, it flows along the ground, searching for food, which, in the case of the lambent witchfyre, is any organic matter that can burn.  \n**Arcane or Alien Origins.** The lambent witchfyre\u2019s exact origins are unknown. Some sages speculate that it was an early attempt by a wizard to infuse life on the Material Plane with elemental essence. Others theorize it is the disastrous byproduct of spell experimentation on an extra-planar creature. Whatever the truth, these strange beings have multiplied and spread, posing a deadly hazard to those who explore the deep caves of the world.  \n**Reproduction.** When a lambent witchfyre has consumed enough organic material, it will seek an isolated place in which to reproduce. It then divides itself into two new lambent witchfyres, each starting with half the parent\u2019s hit points. The offspring then go their separate ways, seeking more life to devour",

    "Lantern Dragonette: _This cat-sized drake with a waxy appearance and a glow emanating from its belly can hover in midair, filling a small area with a warm glow._  \nThe lantern drake is named for its belly, which glows with a warm light. The beast's yellow, waxy scales darken with age, though lantern drakes rarely live more than 50 years or so. They weigh from 5 to 10 pounds and are 18 inches long. Most believe they are the result of an arcane fusion of a radiant spirit with a paper drake.  \n**Eat Candle Wax.** The drake devours four ounces of candle wax per day, plus four more ounces if it uses its belly lantern. A lantern dragonette\u2019s unusual diet leads it to lair in libraries, abbeys, and other places of study. Even though the dragonettes eat candles essential for study during dark hours, they still provide light and protect their adopted homes. Residents and caretakers consider them good luck and enjoy conversing with them.  \n**Telepathic Chatterbox.** This gregarious drake prefers to speak with its companions but uses telepathy if necessary, and the creature hisses when surprised or displeased. It loves nothing more than discussing magic and history with an intelligent and informed individual.  \n**Adventurous Companions.** Occasionally, a dragonette wishing to learn more about the world finds a spellcaster or adventuring party to travel with, purely for the sake of learning or to acquire new sources of knowledge. Most parties enjoy the traveling light source and the abilities these companions bring to bear. A lantern dragonette avoids combat and uses its abilities only to escape or to defend its lair, family, and friends.  \nA dragonette lives up to 30 years. A mated pair produces one clutch of two to five eggs every five years, and one parent raises the young dragonettes until they mature after a year and leave to search for their own lairs. A cloister of lantern dragonettes taxes their lair\u2019s resources, so the other parent often ventures out to retrieve more candles.",
    "Lava Keeper: A rivulet of lava streams from a cavity between the shoulders of this four-armed, volcanic creature._  \n**Volcanic Guardians.** Lava keepers are elementals from the borderlands between the Elemental Planes of Earth and Fire. They sometimes emerge onto the Material Plane through spontaneous elemental vortices in the hearts of volcanoes. Once on the Material Plane, they find themselves trapped. Instead of running rampant, they act as guardians for the region from which they emerged in the hopes that one day they can return home.  \n**Noble Elementals.** Lava keepers are the natural enemies of salamanders and other chaotic elementals.

    "Lazavik: Standing no taller than a cat, this tiny humanoid has a snowwhite beard and a single eye that blazes with golden light. He holds a long reed whip in his hands._  \n**Swamp-Dwelling Fey.** Lazaviks are fey that dwell primarily in swamps and marshes, picking particular tracts of marshland to call home. When it has chosen a suitable location, a lazavik builds a minuscule hut for itself out of dried rushes, mud, and sticks, and it spends its days fishing and enjoying the company of the native animals and good-aligned fey of the region. All lazaviks are male and are thought to sprout like reeds out of the damp soil, though romances between female Open Game License",
    "Leech Swarm: In swampy areas where food is plentiful, leeches gather together in swarms numbering in the hundreds to hunt prey. When their food supply is diminished, the leeches often turn on each other, effectively destroying the swarm. The scent of blood attracts leech swarms, and they easily locate warm-blooded prey. Victims who move out of a leech swarm are not safe, as several leeches remain attached and continue to drain blood until they are removed. These hangers-on are adept at locating hard-to-reach places on their prey as they wriggle into gaps in armor or crawl into boots. Their victims must spend extra time to locate and remove them.",
    "Lemurfolk: _This furred humanoid glides silently through the canopy of trees, gripping a blowgun. It observes visitors cautiously with two intelligent, bulbous eyes._  \n**Jungle Rulers.** These small, intelligent, squirrel-like humanoids live in reclusive, primitive societies deep in the jungle. They are omnivorous, subsisting on fruits and roots, insects and larvae, bird and snake eggs, and birds and small mammals. They sometimes barter with more advanced creatures for metal and crafted items.  \n**Nocturnal Gliders.** Lemurfolk are nocturnal, though they can adopt daytime hours when they must. They prefer to hunt and move by gliding between trees, catching prey off guard.  \n**Greyfur Elders.** Greyfurs are the eldest and most revered kaguani, as much as 80 years old; their age can be estimated by the graying of their fur, but they don\u2019t track the years. Greyfurs are cunning individuals and command the arcane arts, though they rarely pursue the art of necromancy\u2014a strong taboo prohibits them from interacting with the dead.  \nA typical lemurfolk stands 2 feet tall and weighs 30 lb.",

    "Leshy: _A leshy is a strange man wearing loose scraps of clothing and covered in bark and root-like growths. The hair and beard that frame his piercing green eyes writhe like living vines._  \n**Expanding the Wild.** Solitary leshy tend plants and animals in groves around great forests, and they are the self-proclaimed protectors of the forest outskirts. Leshy have little patience for interlopers and often kill, abduct, or frighten off trailblazers and guides. With their plant growth ability, they sabotage cultivated land, wipe out trails, and create weed walls and thickets to keep civilization at bay. Using speak with plants, they transplant dangerous plant creatures to discourage new settlements. Some have wrangled rabid animals to the same purpose.  \n**Ax Thieves.** Leshy prefer trickery to combat, particularly enjoying leading interlopers astray through use of their mimicry. If challenged, they use their ability to change size to scare intruders away, but they never hesitate to fight to the death in service to the forest if necessary. Leshy hate metal, especially axes, and they go out of their way to steal metal items and lead those who use them astray.  \n**Accept Bribes.** With careful courting and appropriate gifts, it is possible to gain a leshy\u2019s capricious assistance. This can be risky, because leshy love mischief. Still, at times a leshy\u2019s help is essential to a group traversing ancient woodlands.",
    "Lesser Lunarchidna: A four-armed, four-legged creature in the vague shape of a human\u2014but seemingly made of fine spider silk\u2014moves down a tree, slowly chanting the incantation of a spell in the pale light of the full moon._  \n**Made in Corrupt Forests.** Lunarchidnas are beings of moonlight and spider silk created in forests permeated by residual dark magic. When this magic coalesces on a spider web touched by the light of a full moon, the web animates. The web gains life and flies through the forest, gathering other webs until it collects enough silk to form a faceless, humanoid body, with four legs and four arms.  \n**Hatred of Elves.** Lunarchidnas hate elves and love to make the creatures suffer. They poison water sources, set fire to villages, and bait monsters into stampeding through elf communities. These aberrations especially enjoy stealing away elf children to use as bait to trap the adults that come to the rescue.  \n**Cyclical Power.** The lunarchidna\u2019s power is tied to the moon. When the skies are dark during a new moon, the lunarchidna becomes more shadow than living web. Its mental ability dulls, and it becomes barely more than a savage animal. When a full moon brightens the night, however, the lunarchidna becomes a conduit of lunar light and can channel that power through its body. Using its heightened intellect, it makes plans, writes notes, and plots from the safety of the trees where it makes its home. In the intermittent phases of the moon, the lunarchidna is a more than capable hunter, trapping and devouring prey it encounters while retaining enough knowledge of its plans and magic to further its goals in minor ways. The lunarchidna\u2019s statistics change cyclically as shown on the Lunarchidna Moon Phase table.  \n\n#### Lunarchidna Moon Phase\n\nMoon Phase\n\nStatistics\n\nDaytime, new, or crescent moon\n\nOpen Game License",
    "Library Automaton: _The humming of servos, ticking of gears, and petite discharges of steam alert you to the presence of this library\u2019s diminutive custodian._  \nThese small constructs were created to fulfill organizational responsibilities of huge libraries with staffing problems, but some invariably learn enough about the wider world to seek out adventure and new knowledge, rather than tending the items in their care.  \n**Eyes of the Past.** While largely constructed with mechanical components, the automatons include a single human eyeball that is mounted at the end of an articulated appendage. The eye is usually donated by one of the institution\u2019s scholars (prescribed in their will) so that they can continue serving the repositories of knowledge that were their life\u2019s work.  \n**Telekinetic.** While the automatons have no arms, they can move and manipulate written materials telekinetically. Powered by keen analytical engines, the library automaton tirelessly pores through tomes, translates ancient texts, catalogs the institution\u2019s volumes, fetches texts for visitors, and occasionally rids the vast halls of uninvited pests.  \n**Sought by Wizards.** Wizards have discovered that these clockwork bureaucrats make particularly effective caretakers for their spellbooks and scrolls while on adventure.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A library automaton doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Lich Hound: _Their howls echoing from another plane, lich hounds always arrive wreathed in mist. Half bone, half purple fire, they are creatures of hunger and the hunt. Nothing makes them happier than taking down creatures larger than themselves\u2014or racing through the air to catch a surprised bat in mid-flight. All cruelty and fang, lich hounds are most satisfied when praised by their great undead lords._  \n**Fiery Bones.** Bright white skulls with a heavy jaw and thick, robust skeletal bodies define the ferocious lich hounds. Their eyes burn green or blue, and their tongues resemble black fire. Fueled by necromantic power, these creatures are loyal servants of either ghoul high priests or liches.  \n**Echoing Howls.** Even on their own, lich hounds are relentless hunters, pursuing their prey with powerful senses and a keen ability to find the living wherever they may hide. Lich hound howls fade into and out of normal hearing, with strangely shifted pitch and echoes.  \n**Murdered Celestials.** The dark process of creating a lich hound involves a perverse ritual of first summoning a celestial canine and binding it to the Material Plane. The hound\u2019s future master then murders the trapped beast. Only then can the creature be animated in all its unholy glory. Hound archons have long been outraged by the creation of lich hounds, and they occasionally band together to rid the world of those who practice this particular dark magic.  \n**Undead Nature.** A lich hound doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Light Drake: The light drake is a small, bulky dragon with two legs and two wings. It has glowing yellow eyes, and light reflects easily off its golden scales._  \n**Light Bringers.** Light drakes are obsessed with bringing light into dark places, and often inhabit the darkest parts of the world. They use their light to aid lost travelers and defeat the denizens of the darkest parts of the world. They are regularly hunted by such denizens, who offer large rewards for their golden hides.  \n**Social Trinket-Collectors.** Light drakes are social creatures that live in small, glowing colonies in deep caverns. Like their larger cousins, they enjoy collecting trinkets, though they prefer objects made of bright metals or iridescent stones. They often adorn themselves with such trinkets and use their light magic to make the trinkets shine. Light drakes tend to sleep together in piles for warmth and light in the cold darkness, which has led to many a thief inadvertently stumbling into a colony of the jewelry-coated sleeping drakes after mistaking them for a pile of glittering treasure.  \n**Undead Slayers.** Light drakes despise undead and any creatures that use light, or the absence of light, to prey on innocents. They have a particularly strong hatred for Open Game License",
    "Likho: _Malformed like a goblin, this creature bears one large, strange eye in the middle of its face. It wears dark and dirty rags, and its spindly claws and arms match its hunched torso._  \n**Ferocious Attitude.** Likho are scrappy fighters; they weaken foes from afar with their magical attacks to curse and enfeeble enemies, then rush forward in a blazing charge and jump onto their foes, shredding them with their claws. Once a likho has leapt onto a creature, it shreds flesh using the claws on both its hands and feet.  \n**Jeers and Insults.** A likho uses its message spells to taunt and jeer its target from a distance during the hunt. In addition, to flinging curses and ill luck, likho frustrate and infuriate their enemies because they are difficult to hit. A likho enjoys stalking intelligent humanoids and tormenting them from hiding until discovered or when it grows tired of the hunt.  \n**Organ Eaters.** Likho thrive when they drain away luck and aptitude. Once the likho immobilizes a creature, it gnaws at the creature\u2019s abdomen with its jagged teeth, devouring the organs of its still-living prey. A likho consumes only a humanoid\u2019s organs and leaves the rest of the carcass behind.",

Their talons are long and curved, acting as skates or short skis when moving over ice. Few things are swifter on the ice.  \n**Sea Hunters.** In the wild, lindwurms hunt in groups, looking for breaching whales, seals, or incautious fishermen. They employ wolf-pack tactics and enjoy surprising foes. With their considerable cunning, they may skate by their prey at speed, snapping a bite as they pass or snatching them up with their constricting tails.",
    "Liosalfar: _The curtain of rippling colors assumes a humanoid form. Its kaleidoscope body shifts and glitters with mesmeric patterns._  \nSometimes known as \u201clight elves\u201d because they assume a vaguely elfish shape, these enigmatic shapeshifters make their home at the edge of the world, where reality bends and physical laws unravel. Their mutable bodies are composed entirely of shifting colors. Among themselves they communicate through flashing patterns and hues, but they talk to other races in an echoing, choral tone that seems to emanate from everywhere and nowhere around them.  \n**Servants of Fate.** Their aims often seem inconsequential or simply baffling, but they\u2019ve also sundered mountains and toppled kingdoms. Many believe they\u2019re agents of Fate, others that their motivation is an alien aesthetic or their own amusement.  \n**Pattern Vision.** Those who\u2019ve spoken with liosalfar say they talk as if all existence was a sea of patterns and colors to be set in pleasing shapes. They barely understand mortal concerns.  \n**Enemies of the Ramag.** The liosalfar have a longstanding rivalry with the portal-making ramag, whom they despise as \u201ccorruptors of the patterns.\u201d  \n**Elemental Nature.** A liosalfar doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Living Wick: _A living wick is a small, rough wax sculpture of a human that stands at attention, a halo of light flickering around its head from some source behind it._  \n**Enchanted Wicks.** Living wicks are obedient wax statues brought to life by an enchanted wick that runs from the nape of their neck to their lower back. When new, a living wick looks and moves like a human, but as the wick burns, the wax features melt and the statue takes on a twisted, hunchbacked appearance.  \n**Short-Lived as a Candle.** Living wicks are powered by flames, and therefore they have a predetermined life cycle. They are typically reduced to formless lumps in a month, but some say a living wick\u2019s affordability more than makes up for its inevitable obsolescence. Individuals looking to quickly construct a building or fortification without the expense of paid labor or the questionable ethics of necromancy find living wicks obedient and efficient, as do those needing an army for a single battle.  \nLiving wicks are active only when their wicks are lit, and only respond to the telepathic commands of whoever lit them. This makes it easy to transfer living wicks between owners, even those not well-versed in the use of magic.  \n**Explosive Ends.** The amount of magical energy contained within a living wick, paired with the manner in which it is released, gives them a remarkable capability for selfdestruction. If their controller demands it, all living wicks can release the magic contained within their form all at once, engulfing themselves and anyone nearby in flames. This can make storing them a gamble, but many see it as an asset, especially those seeking to destroy evidence or anonymously attack their enemies.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A living wick doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

The hundreds of keys hanging about its form jingle as it moves._  \n**Call the Locksmith.** These odd entities are the best in the business at creating secure doors and gates, impassable barriers, and locks of all varieties. They may be inclined to wander from place to place or set up shop in metropolises, offering their services to create or unlock barriers of any kind.  \n**Professional Rivalry.** Each locksmith has a distinct appearance and personality, but they all share the same skill set. A locksmith instantly recognizes the handiwork of another locksmith. When a locksmith encounters a barrier constructed by another of its kind, it is compelled to break the barrier or build a superior version. A locksmith hired to undo the work of one of its fellows often volunteers for the task free of charge.  \n**Key Features.** Locksmiths are unique in appearance, but all share a generally humanoid shape. Regardless of other details, they all possess empty keyholes where a human nose would typically be. The key that fits this lock is responsible for imbuing the locksmith with its consciousness. Locksmiths build incredibly complex hidden vaults to hide away these treasured keys.  \n**Construct Nature.** The locksmith doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Lorelei: _Lounging on large river rocks or within swirling eddies untouched by the rush of the current, these breathtakingly fey call plaintively to travelers and knights errant. They seek nothing less than the last breath of a drowning man._  \n**Death to Men.** These callous river sirens compete with one another in manipulating and destroying male travelers. A lorelei often taunts her prey for days before finally turning on it. When the opportunity presents itself, it quickly draws heavily armored warriors into deep water and kisses them as they drown.  \n**Voluptuous Humanoids.** Although legends describe the lorelei as golden-haired and fair-skinned, they come in all varieties, each more voluptuous than the next. While most resemble sensual humans, a lorelei\u2019s form can also include elves, dwarves, and in some recorded cases even orcs and hobgoblins\u2014a lorelei mimics her most frequent prey.  \n**Ignore Women.** Women travelers are vexing for the lorelei. While the siren\u2019s powers affect women as readily as men, the lorelei lacks the urge to destroy them. Women traveling alone or in all-female groups may pass through a lorelei\u2019s territory safely, and might even make peaceful contact. However, women who protect male companions are viewed as traitors, inspiring wrath.",
    "Loxoda: _Often called elephant centaurs by humans and gnolls, loxodas are massive creatures that combine the torso of an ogre and the body of an elephant. Hating and fearing all strangers, they live in open plains and scrubland._  \n**Nomadic Families.** Loxodas live in small herds of 2-3 extended families. Several of these communities will usually cluster together, allowing members to move between groups as they get older. They have no permanent settlements, and instead loxoda families travel to new areas when they deplete the available food. Voracious eaters, a family of loxodas will quickly strip trees bare of leaves, or hunt and cook an entire elephant. They devour both meat and vegetation.  \n**Often Underestimated.** Many people assume that loxodas are as dull witted as the ogres they resemble. This is often a fatal mistake, as the elephant centaurs are quite intelligent. Their simple equipment and straightforward living comes not from a lack of skill or knowledge, but their own isolationism and xenophobia. Their immense size and quadruped body makes it difficult for them to mine metal ore, and they violently reject communications and trade with other people. The little metal they can gather is either taken from the bodies of their prey or stolen in raids on dwarven, human, or gnoll settlements.  \n**Vestigial Tusks.** All loxodas have curved tusks. While they are too small for use in even ritual combat, they are often decorated with intricate carvings, inlays or dyed in a pattern developed by their family. Each individual also adapts the patterns with their own individual marks, often inspired by important events in their lives. Some loxodas put golden rings or jewelled bracelets stolen from humanoids onto their tusks as trophies\u2014a loxoda matriarch may have long dangling chains of such ornaments, indicating her high status and long life. They stand 18 feet tall and weigh nearly 20,000 pounds.",
    "Luck Leech: The elf-like creature rises, its bright green eyes flashing with menace. Short, impish horns peek out from its inky hair, and green smoke oozes out of the numerous circular mouths lining its arms._  \nWhen a humanoid who earned wealth through violence and duplicity gets lost in the Shadow Realm, its body becomes corrupted by the dark realm, turning it into a luck leech. These fey have arms covered in lamprey-like mouths that drain the luck out of their victims. They return to the Material Plane and stalk gambling houses and criminal underbellies for exceptionally lucky targets.  \n**Amassing fortune.** Luck leeches obsess over gathering as much wealth and luck as possible, referring to both collectively as \u201cfortune.\u201d They rarely notice and never care if their acquisition of fortune harms others.  \n**Self-Serving.** A luck leech cares first and foremost about itself. If it thinks its life is in danger, it expends any fortune it has to escape, knowing it can\u2019t enjoy its fortune if it\u2019s dead.",
    "Lunar Devil: _A hulking figure floats in the air, a winged horror painted in mist and moonlight._  \n**Corruptors of the Moon.** Always standing a bit apart from the machinations of the Dukes of Hell due to their dependence on moonlight, lunar devils can be found subverting druidical orders or leading packs of werewolves. They are a lazy breed of devil, and prefer lounging in the light of the moon over any more vigorous activity. The only exception is an opportunity to corrupt druids and moon-worshippers, pitting them against followers of sun gods.  \n**Vain and Boastful.** Lunar devils are as vain as they are indolent, and tales the fey tell of them involve thwarting them by appealing to their vanity. Lunar devils frequently befriend the dark fey.  \n**Flying in Darkness.** In combat, lunar devils sometimes cast fly on allies to bring them along, and they stay in areas of moonlight whenever they can. Lunar devils have excellent vision in total darkness as well, though, and are happy to use that against foes. At range, they use hurl moonlight and lightwalking to frustrate enemies. In melee, they use wall of ice to split foes, the better to battle just half at a time.",

Its black lidless eyes are filled with envy and sorrow._  \n**Condemned to the Dark.** Lunarians are a race of mothlike fey originally from the moon. However, after attempting to take the moon\u2019s power for themselves, they were cast out by a fey lord and damned to the depths of the world, never to see their lunar home again.  \n**Angels of the Underworld.** Stories tell of lunarians helping people far below the surface, striking down monsters at the last moment. However, they never do so for free, often demanding valuable trinkets from the surface as payment for their services. If those they rescue deny them a reward or give them a bad one, they are prone to attack.",

It has the body of a tiny hawk, the colorful wings of a butterfly, and the head of an elf with large, luminous eyes._  \n**Miniscule Fey.** Dwelling in pastoral woods and rich farmland, the lymarien is one of the smallest fey in existence.

    "Mad Piper: A grey mound of flesh scuttles forward on mismatched limbs, its five heads trilling along on bone flutes. All the while, a harrowing tune plays from the column of pipes rising from its core._  \nMad pipers are the heralds of the Great Old Ones, a sign that a cult is getting close to achieving their goals. Cultists receive visions from their masters, filling their dreams with the esoteric rituals needed to create a mad piper. In short order, the cult gathers the components and creates these creatures, typically one for each cell of the cult. When the time comes for the cult to do battle, the mad pipers follow, inspiring the faithful with the alien songs of the Great Old Ones.  \n**The Ritual.** During the ritual, five humanoids, one of which must be a musician of some kind, are tied to a set of bagpipes made from an ogre\u2019s bones and stomach. The ritual liquefies the humanoids, who fall into each other as all but their limbs and heads dissolve into a mass of grey flesh. Their minds, souls, and bodies forcefully merged, they start to play.  \n**Pets and Mascots.** Mad pipers aren\u2019t naturally evil. Most are made from commoners, resulting in relatively docile and loyal creatures that imprint quickly onto cult members, who in turn often come to treat these abominations as pets. More violent and powerful mad pipers can be made from powerful, evil humanoids, though they are harder to control and often hostile to their creators.  \n**True Pipers.** Scholars speculate that the mad pipers are modelled after the heralds of the Crawling Chaos, and that it was he who gifted the first ritual to mortals on behalf of all Great Old Ones.  \n**Construct Nature.** The mad piper doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

    "Magma Octopus: Eight tentacles reach out from the scorched body of this unusual octopus-like creature. Glowing yellow, orange, and red patches smolder on its skin, like embers flaring to life._  \n**Elemental Bodies.** Magma octopuses are creatures that physically resemble the marine animals for which they are named, but they make their homes in lava, swimming through it as easily as aquatic octopuses swim through water. Born in the fiery seas of the Plane of Fire long ago, many magma octopuses wandered to the Material Plane through various portals and thinned barriers between the planes. They exist throughout the world, particularly in underground caverns with open lava flows, within the craters of some volcanoes, and swimming through underground networks of magma.  \n**Intelligent.** Magma octopuses live simple lives with a quiet intelligence that slightly surpasses that of aquatic octopuses. They have no language and cannot communicate verbally. They are known to recognize individuals from other species and remember individuals that might have caused them pain or helped them out of a bad situation. Magma octopuses only fight others if they are attacked first, but they can become extremely territorial if intruders tread too close to home. They have a fondness for fire-based magic and sometimes can be recruited to serve as guardians for wizards, efreeti, and other powerful, fiery creatures.  \n**Elemental Nature.** A magma octopus doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Magnetic Elemental: The large, smooth rock stands, the air around it humming with energy. As it walks, nearby daggers, lanterns, and buckled boots move to follow it._  \nMagnetic elementals spontaneously appear where the Plane of Earth meets the Plane of Air. They are magnetized, rocky creatures capable of switching their polarity to repel attacks and pull enemies closer.  \n**Smooth Stone.** Magnetic elementals are worn smooth by the elemental air that creates them. They are able to harness this air to fly, and, when on the Material Plane, they occupy areas where vast swaths of stone are exposed to the sky, such as mountain peaks and deep canyons.  \n**Iron Summons.** Spellcasters who want to conjure a magnetic elemental must mix iron shavings into the soft clay. Such spellcasters must take caution, however, as the elementals often inadvertently attract the armor and weapons of those nearby.  \n**Elemental Nature.** The magnetic elemental doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Mahoru: _\u201cI saw no more terrible beast on all my journeys north than the mahoru. The white bears had their aloof majesty, the lindwurm serpentine grace, but the monster that gnawed away the pack ice beneath our feet and savaged any who fell into the water was a thing of nightmare. The men it snatched were torn apart, like rags in the mouth of a rabid dog.\u201d_  \nA hybrid of fish and mammal, a mahoru is eight feet long and looks like a small orca with a serpentine neck and seal-like head.  \n**Valuable Teeth and Fur.** Their heavy jaws are filled with triangular, serrated teeth adept at tearing flesh and sundering bone. Their white and black fur is highly prized for its warmth and waterproof qualities. Their pectoral fins feature stubby, claw-tipped paws. Skraeling use the mahoru\u2019s fangs to make arrowheads or tooth-studded clubs, and the mahoru is a totem beast for many northern tribes.  \n**Iceberg Hunters.** Relatives of the bunyip, mahoru prowl northern coasts and estuaries, hunting among the fragmenting pack ice each summer. They lurk beneath the surface, catching swimmers chunks or lurching up onto the ice to break or tilt it and send prey tumbling into the water. When necessary, they stalk beaches and riverbanks in search of carrion or unwary victims.  \n**Work in Pairs and Packs.** Mahoru work together in mated pairs to corral everything from fish and seals to larger prey like kayaking humans and even polar bears. They gnaw at ice bridges and the frozen surface of lakes and rivers to create fragile patches that plunge unwary victims into their waiting jaws.",
    "Major Malleable: A pile of red, gooey flesh slurps along the ground. The meat climbs upon itself, squishing as it creates a formidable, hungry wall._  \nMalleables are malevolent, formless piles of flesh that absorb psychic energy and grow smarter and stronger when combined together.  \n**Consumers of Psychic Power.** Creatures that consume psychic energy can become so infused with it that their bodies implode. The power lingers in the grotesque mass of flesh, warping the creature\u2019s mind even more than its body and creating a hunter that hungers to consume and grow. Malleables do not remember their personal lives before implosion, but they do retain facts and lore. They think themselves superior to all other creatures, which are simply prey. Their goals are simple: drain every creature they can of psychic energy and rule the world as a massive, roiling meat puddle. Malleables have infinite patience and can wait centuries until they feel the time is right to go on a psychic energy binge.  \n**Many Shapes.** Malleables have no set form, but they can stretch and alter their forms easily, moving on appendages or flowing like an ooze. They might form a face (or many faces at once) if they wish to convey an emotion to another creature, or take the shape of a truly terrifying beast (like a giant spider) if they wish to create panic. No matter the shape they take, malleables always appear to be a fleshy creature turned inside out.  \n**Our Powers Combined.** Malleables can join together, creating a larger, more powerful creature that shares the intellect of all the combined intelligences. These bigger malleables can separate into smaller aberrations when it suits them.  \n**Ancient Knowledge Hoarders.** It is said that malleables have perfect memories and the oldest of these creatures remember ancient lore other creatures have long forgotten. Many sages have tried and failed to capture malleables to prod their minds for secrets, but the creatures almost always find a way to escape.

    "Malakbel: _Within a blinding wave of heat and glare strides a long-limbed, misshapen form. The creature scorches everything in its path as it strides forward._  \nWhat most people recall most vividly from an encounter with a malakbel is the blinding light and blistering heat surrounding them. Rippling distortion obscures the creature\u2019s body, which is roughly the size and shape of an adult human.  \n_**Demonic Messengers.**_ Malakbel demons are contradictory creatures. They are both messengers and destroyers who carry the words of demon lords or even dark gods to the mortal realm. Paradoxically, once their message is delivered, they often leave none of its hearers alive to spread the tale.  \n_**Where Virtue Cannot Look.**_ The malakbel is the embodiment of all that is forbidden and destructive. Despite its vital role as a messenger, its destructive nature always comes to the fore. A malakbel descends upon settlements and travelers with the merciless and relentless onslaught of the raging sun, burning all it sees to cinders before vanishing like heat shimmers at dusk.",

Suddenly, the air becomes so dry as to make the eyes sting and lips crack. The imposing figure has yellow points of light for eyes._  \n**Cold Plateau Mummies.** The people of the cold, rainless, mountain plateaus take advantage of their dry climes to mummify their honored dead, but without the embalming and curing of the corpse practiced in hotter lands. To preserve the knowledge and the place of their ancestors in the afterlife, their dead remain among them as counsellors and honorees on holy days.  \n**Undead Judges.** The mallqui are not seen as malevolent, though at times they are severe judges against transgressors of their culture\u2019s ideals.  \n**Icons of Growth.** Through their ability to draw the very moisture from the air, they are seen as conduits to the fertility of the earth. \u201cMallqui\u201d also means \u201csapling\u201d in the language of the people who create them.  \n**Undead Nature.** A mallqui doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Its slimy green bat\u2011like wings seem too small to work, yet it flies very well._  \n**Twisted Field Sprites.** Mamuras are the twisted faeries of magical wastelands and barren plains. They were once goodaligned, pixie-like fey called \u201cpolevoi,\u201d or \u201cfield sprites,\u201d but at some point they swore their souls to a dark goddess and were corrupted by her foul magic. Now they are twisted, alien things.  \n**Cross-Dimensional.** The mamura is one degree out of phase with the usual five dimensions. As a result, it always appears blurry and indistinct even in bright light, and it seems translucent in dim light.  \nMamuras babble constantly, but their talk is mostly nonsense. Their minds operate in multiple dimensions in time as well as space, and this allows them to talk to creatures of the Realms Beyond. Because of this, their babble may be prophetic, but only few can decipher it.  \n**Prophetic Followers.** They occasionally align themselves with powerful goblin tribes or evil wasteland sorcerers for their own unknowable purposes.",

The graven glyphs on their carapaces resemble the priestly cuneiform of long-dead kingdoms, and the more magical energy they consume, the brighter they glow, up to the equivalent of a torch.  \nManabane scarabs pursue magic without hesitation or fear, tirelessly seeking to drain it for sustenance.",

    "Mangrove Treant: Gnarled roots reaching deep into the muck act as legs for this group of trees conjoined into a sentient being._  \n**Ancient Grove Guardians.** Mangrove treants provide shelter and a resource-rich environment for many creatures. They extend their roots into the water, where several species of fish thrive. Biting and stinging insects, most notably mosquitos, dart about in cloud-like formations near the water\u2019s surface. Arboreal animals nest high among the treants\u2019 boughs mostly removed from the depredations of the insects. Unlike their forest cousins, these swampland treants are more concerned with the safety of those under their protection and less concerned with the overall health of the swamp. They decisively react to direct threats to themselves and the creatures within their boughs and roots, but they may not act if something endangers an area outside their immediate groves.  \nMangrove treants continue to grow throughout their extraordinarily long lives, which can reach millennia if they see no external disruptions. The treants also add ordinary mangrove trees into their gestalt, incorporating the trees\u2019 ecosystems into its whole.  \n**Friend to Lizardfolk.** While a mangrove treant is generally wary of civilization, it befriends Open Game License",

Though it doesn\u2019t require food, drink, or sleep, it consumes as much as a horse of its size and requires bedding that is comfortable, clean, and large enough to suit its frame. Despite its apparently baleful nature, the mari lwyd does not seek to harm its hosts, physically or financially, and demands only what they can comfortably provide. It defends itself if attacked, reciting rhymes beseeching its hosts to calm themselves.  \nA mari lwyd may accompany itself with a \u201cretinue\u201d of skeletons. It refuses to animate zombies, because it doesn\u2019t wish to trouble its hosts with the smell of rotting flesh. It also politely refuses hospitality on the behalf of its cohorts.  \n**Expelled by Rhyme.** Other than through its physical destruction, the only way to rid oneself of a mari lwyd is to win a rhyming battle. It speaks only in rhyme, often changing languages for the best rhyme scheme between verses, which may provide a clue to those inconvenienced by the mari lwyd. It is especially appreciative of clever rhymes. The mari lwyd usually incorporates winning rhymes into its repertoire. Should a mari lwyd revisit a location, the inhabitants must come up with an even better rhyme to oust the creature.  \nThe mari lwyd takes more conventional methods of turning away undead as an affront. If affected by a cleric\u2019s turning attempt, it leaves for the duration and waits for the cleric to exit the premises before returning and increasing its demands for hospitality.  \n**Undead Nature.** A mari lwyd doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

At the base of a crater left by a meteor that destroyed a civilization, the two devised a plan to not merely slay their peers, but wholly expunge them from time itself, leaving only each other. Shortly thereafter, the mask wights were conceived.  \n**Rites of Annihilation.** To create these undead, the lord of shadows stole the bodies of death knights from beneath the necropolis of an arch-lich. Then, the goddess of the underworld sacrificed a million condemned souls and drained their essence into ivory masks\u2014one for each fiend the couple sought to annihilate. Finally, the masks were hammered onto the knights with cold iron nails, and their armored husks were left at the bottom of the memory-draining River Styx for 600 years.  \nWhen they rose, the mask wights marched out into the planes to bury knowledge, conjure secrets, and erase their quarry from memory and history.  \n**Ready for Betrayal.** Kept secret from one another, though, the two each created an additional mask wight, a safeguard for in case betrayal should cross their lover\u2019s mind.  \n**Undead Nature.** A mask wight doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

When together, they fear few predators. Even dragons take caution when hunting a herd of them and more often than not choose to seek easier prey.  \n**Docile Livestock.** Due to their docile nature, mei jiao shou are often kept as semi-wild livestock by giants and some humanoid tribes.

They travel in large numbers between worlds, somehow folding space to cover astronomical distances in months rather than decades.  \n**Alien Technology.** Their technology includes mastery of living things, powerful techniques to implant mi-go elements and even minds in alien bodies (or to extract them), and an unparalleled mastery of living tissue in both plant and animal form. While they have their own secrets and goals, they also serve ancient powers from between the stars and carry on an interstellar effort to conquer and spread their species.  \n**World Colonizers.** The mi-go are devoted followers of Shub-Niggurath, the goddess of fecundity and growth, and take their evangelical mission extremely seriously. They colonize entire worlds in Shub-Niggurath\u2019s name, and they plant and harvest entire species according to her will.  \n**Brain Cylinders.** One of the apexes of mi-go technology is the brain cylinder, a device that permits the extraction and maintenance of a living brain outside the body. Safely isolated in a mi-go cylinder, a human brain can be transported between the stars, sheltered\u2014mostly\u2014from the psyche-crushing effects of interstellar space. They deploy, fill, and retrieve these cylinders according to schedules and for purposes mysterious to others.

    "Millitaur: _The millitaur is a purplish-black segmented worm the size of a horse, with hundreds of legs, black multifaceted eyes and thick powerful mandibles. They wield crude stone axes._  \n**Mulch Eaters.** Millitaurs roam jungles and woodlands, where dense undergrowth rots beneath the canopy and piles high; leaves and plants provide much of the millitaur diet. Though millitaurs are territorial, they sometimes chase away threats rather than kill intruders. However, they also are good hunters and supplement their diet with squirrel, monkey, and even gnome or goblin.  \n**Poisonous Drool.** As formidable as they appear, millitaurs are the preferred prey of some dragons and jungle giants, and tosculi often hunt them for use as slaves and pack animals. In defense, they\u2019ve developed a mild poison. Millitaur handaxes often drip with this substance, smeared onto them from the beast\u2019s mandibles.

When inhaled, mindrot spores enter the brain through the bloodstream. As the fungus grows, it dissolves the host\u2019s body and slowly replaces the creature\u2019s flesh with its own.  \nThe fungus\u2019s first target is the motor function of the brain. It takes control of the creature\u2019s movement while the victim is still alive and fully conscious\u2014but no longer controls his or her own body! Indeed, sensory awareness may be the last function that the fungus attacks. Eventually, even the victim\u2019s skin and muscle are replaced with fungal fibers. At that point, the affected creature no longer looks like its former self. Such a newly-born mindrot thrall conceals its alarming appearance under heavy robes or cloaks so it can travel without causing alarm.  \n**Spore Blisters.** A thrall\u2019s skin is taut and waxy. Blisters form just beneath the surface, and when they grow as large as a child\u2019s fist they burst, releasing a spray of spores. It seeks to infect as many new victims as possible during the few weeks that it survives in humanoid form. At the end of that time, the thrall shrivels to a dried, vaguely humanoid husk. Even a dead mindrot thrall, however, is still dangerous because its half-formed spore blisters can remain infectious for months. Disturbing the husk can burst these blisters and trigger a Mindrot Spores attack.  \n**Dimensional Horrors.** Wizards hypothesize the fungus was brought to the mortal world by a shambling horror crossing through a dimensional portal. The remoteness of that wasteland is likely whythe mindrot fungus hasn\u2019t destroyed whole cities, though someday it may find a more fertile breeding ground.",

Its body appears wet and oily, though an unusual crystalline pattern decorates the surface._  \n**Subterranean Menace.** A mineral ooze is a slime that hardens into solid rock after it engulfs its target, making escape much more difficult as it slowly digests the creature.  \n**Earthy Consistency.** The mineral ooze has a high concentration of silicates and crystal, which appear on the surface of the creature when it is in its gelatinous form. When it engulfs a creature, these minerals are pushed to the surface, where they harden quickly, trapping the creature. The ooze reverts to its liquid form after it has finished digesting the creature or if the creature escapes.  \n**Ooze Nature.** A mineral ooze doesn\u2019t require sleep.",

Whether male or female, a mirager dresses in veils and flowing robes that accentuate its enticing beauty.  \n**Thirst for Blood.** Whatever its apparent form, a mirager\u2019s existence is one of unnatural and endless thirst.

As a result, many of these paths lead unwary travelers into the grove of a green hag coven or into the lair of a black dragon.  \n**Swamp.** Miremals have adapted from sylvan forests to the swamps: patches of red and green fungus sprout from their skin, mushrooms and branches grow haphazardly out of their bodies, and moss hangs from beneath their arms. Their eyes are forest green and are perpetually wet with bloody tears\u2014their legends say their tears come from rage over their banishment and agony from knowing they can never return.  \n**Hate Moss Lurkers.** Miremals are occasionally confused with moss lurkers, but the two despise one another and both consider the comparison odious.",
    "Mirror Hag: _A mirror hag forces an unsuspecting creature to reflect on its own superficiality by gazing into the hag\u2019s horrible face._  \n**Hideous Hex.** Until a creature can see past the hag\u2019s deformities, it suffers the pain of a disfigured life. Some mirror hags do this for the betterment of all, but most do it because causing pain amuses them.  \n**Warped Features.** Mirror hags are hunchbacked, with growths and lesions covering their skin. Their joints misalign, and the extremities of their bones press against their skin. However, it is their faces that inspire legends: the blackest moles sprouting long white hairs, noses resembling half-eaten carrots, and eyes mismatched in size, color, and alignment. If a creature recoils from a mirror hag\u2019s looks, she bestows her reconfiguring curse on it.  \n**Mirror Covens.** Mirror hags can form a coven with two other hags. Generally, mirror hags only form covens with other mirror hags, but from time to time a mirror hag will join a coven of witches or green hags.",

Also called nunda (\u201csmoke-cats\u201d), mngwas are strong and cunning hunters that can elude pursuit or approach their prey unnoticed by disappearing into the ether for a brief time.  \n**Rocky Terrain.** Mngwas choose their hunting ground carefully, avoiding flatlands where competing predators are plentiful. They favor rocky and treacherous terrain where their talent for dancing along the veil between worlds allows them to easily outmaneuver their prey.  \n**Feline Allies.** The strongest mngwa recruit other great cats into their prides, though these associations tend to be shortlived. They hunt with especially savage groups of nkosi, though only a great pridelord can command one during a hunt. When the hunt is over, the mngwa move on, and sometimes they take one of the young nkosi with them to become a shaman.",

No matter the shape they take, malleables always appear to be a fleshy creature turned inside out.  \n**Our Powers Combined.** Malleables can join together, creating a larger, more powerful creature that shares the intellect of all the combined intelligences. These bigger malleables can separate into smaller aberrations when it suits them.  \n**Ancient Knowledge Hoarders.** It is said that malleables have perfect memories and the oldest of these creatures remember ancient lore other creatures have long forgotten. Many sages have tried and failed to capture malleables to prod their minds for secrets, but the creatures almost always find a way to escape. Adventurers are often given the dangerous tasks of capturing, guarding, or questioning a malleable.",
    "Monolith Champion: _This suit of armor stands motionless, its visor raised to reveal a black skull with eyes cold as a winter moon. A cloak of owl feathers hangs from its shoulders, and a greatsword is slung across its back._  \n**Beautiful Constructs.** Monolithic servitors are constructs designed to serve the courts of the shadow fey. As constructs go, these are uncommonly beautiful; they are meant to be as pleasing to the eyes as they are functional. Beauty, of course, is in the eye of the beholder, and what\u2019s beautiful in the eyes of the shadow fey might be considered strange, disturbing, or even alarming by mortal folk.  \n**Expensive Armor.** Regardless of a viewer\u2019s esthetic opinion, it\u2019s obvious that a monolith champion incorporates amazing workmanship. Every fitting is perfect; every surface is masterfully burnished and etched with detail almost invisible to the naked eye or decorated with macabre inlays and precious chasing. The skull in the helmet is mere decoration, meant to frighten the weak of heart and mislead opponents into thinking the champion is some form of undead rather than a pure construct.  \n**Keeping Out the Rabble.** As its name implies, the monolith champion serves as a guardian, warrior, or sentry. In those roles, it never tires, never becomes distracted or bored, never questions its loyalty, and never swerves from its duty. It delights in throwing non-fey visitors out of fey settlements and buildings.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A monolith champion doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Monolith Footman: _A suit of elven parade armor, beautifully ornate but perhaps not terribly functional, stands at attention._  \n**Beautiful Construct.** Like the Open Game License",
    "Moonkite: This fantastic creature is almost uniformly circular in shape, its bizarre form composed of six pairs of bright silver hawk wings flapping in perfect unison. Despite its odd appearance, the creature moves gracefully through the air._  \n**Ordered Forms.** The circular bodies of these bizarre, spherical celestials are surrounded by six identical wings of burnished silver. Many angels like devas and planetars see moonkites as the perfect unity of form and function, and often extol their virtues to mortals when trying to convince them of the grandeur of the heavens. Moonkites themselves rarely communicate, but when they do, their wings vibrate in time with their words.  \n**Heavenly Steeds.** Though most celestials do not ride mounts nor use creatures like pegasi and unicorns as steeds, moonkites sometimes serve as mounts for powerful celestial generals and heroes, especially those that do not possess a humanoid form. The moonkite can outfly most other creatures, and it is particularly hardy against the powers of demons and devils, making it a valuable mount to many celestials. Celestials riding a moonkite never treat it as a lesser creature, instead often confiding in the moonkite or asking for its opinion.  \n**Gifts from Above.** When the world is in dire peril from a powerful chaotic or evil threat, moonkites have been known to assist good-aligned heroes as steeds. Any mortal that gains a moonkite as an ally must uphold the tenets of truth, heroism, and generosity, lest it lose the celestial\u2019s assistance.  \n**Immortal Nature.** The moonkite doesn\u2019t require food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Mordant Snare: _Mordant snares were created by war mages of ancient times. Each resembles an immense, dark gray, 11-armed starfish weighing eight tons, and yet a mordant snare is never obvious. Instead, it controls a few humanoids shuffling about aimlessly, their skin glistening with moisture, occasionally forming loose groups near the snare. These puppets pay little attention to their surroundings._  \n**Starfish Puppet Masters.** Snares bury themselves under loose soil to attack creatures walking above them. They attack by extruding filaments that inject acid into victims; this liquefies organs and muscle while leaving the skeleton, tendons, and skin intact. With the body thus hollowed out and refilled with acid and filaments, the mordant snare can control it from below like a puppet, creating a group of awkward, disoriented people. New victims fall prey to mordant snares when they approach to investigate.  \n**Brains Preferred.** The mordant snare prefers intelligent food. With its tremorsense, it can easily distinguish between prey; it prefers Small and Medium bipeds. A mordant snare hunts an area until it is empty, so a village can suffer tremendous losses or even be wiped out before discovering what\u2019s happening. However, a mordant snare is intelligent enough to know that escaped victims may come back with friends, shovels, and weapons, ready for battle. When this occurs, the snare abandons its puppets, burrows deeper underground, and seeks a new home.  \n**Cooperative Killers.** Mordant snares are few in number and cannot reproduce. Since the secret of their creation was lost long ago, eventually they will disappear forever\u2014until then, they cooperate well with each other, using puppets to lure victims to one another. A team is much more dangerous than a lone snare, and when three or more link up, they are especially deadly.",
    "Morphoi: _These blue-skinned humanoids wield tridents and have unusual faces with vertical eyes but no mouth or nose._  \n**Shapeshifter Plants.** Morphoi are shape-shifting plant creatures indigenous to many islands. In their natural forms, the morphoi are androgynous beings between 5 and 6 feet tall. Their elliptical heads have eyes on both front and back. When harmed, they bleed a dark red sap.  \nAs plants, the morphoi don\u2019t need to eat. Instead, they gather nutrients from the sun and air. When posing as humanoids, they consume small amounts of food to aid their disguise, but since they have no internal digestive system, the food is just stored inside their bodies until they can spit it out.  \n**Ship Travel.** Morphoi live in island communities and in nearby waters. Many travel by ship\u2014usually by posing as beautiful women, handsome men, or stranded travelers. They harbor a powerful animosity toward intelligent animal life, and their disguised agents are behind many otherwise inexplicable acts of sabotage and murder. Unlike doppelgangers, morphoi can\u2019t mimic specific individuals or read thoughts. Instead, they create intriguing backgrounds to go along with their disguises.  \n**Four Eyes Always.** No matter what form they shift into, morphoi always have four eyes, never two. They can relocate their eyes to anywhere on their bodies, however, and they try to keep the second pair of eyes on the back of the head or neck (concealed by long hair or a tall collar), or the backs of the hands (under gloves but useful to peer around corners).  \nAbout one in 30 morphoi are chieftains, and they have rangers, shamans, and warlocks among them. Those chosen as infiltrators are often rogues or bards. Stories tell of shapeshifted morphoi falling in love with humans, but it is impossible for the two species to interbreed.",
    "Moss Lurker: _Somewhat like the cruel crossbreed of troll and gnome, the moss lurkers are a primitive race of forest and cavern dwellers with long, greenish beards and hair. Their hides are mossy green or peaty amber, and a vaguely fungal scent surrounds them at all times._  \nLike their trollish relatives, moss lurkers have large and often grotesque noses. Their claws are bright red when unsheathed, and their teeth tend toward the long and snaggly. They wear simple clothes of homespun wool or leather, or go naked in the summer. Their hats are sometimes festooned with toadstools or ferns as primitive camouflage.  \n**Rocks and Large Weapons.** Moss lurkers have a fondness for throwing stones onto enemies from a great height, and they often employ enormous axes, warhammers, and two-handed swords that seem much larger than such a small creature should be able to lift.",
    "Mountain Dryad: An enormous woman covered in rocky formations accented with crystals emerges from the mountainside._  \nOften mistaken for giants, mountain dryads are huge fey who are tied to primal mountains.  \n**Like the Mountain.** Mountain dryads are sturdier than their smaller, frailer sisters. Their beauty is more rugged, with hair the color of lichen and skin the shade of their mountain\u2019s stone.  \n**Despise Mining.** Mountain dryads tend to spend long stretches of time sleeping deep within their mountains, and they do not take kindly to the scarring of their homes. The dryads have a particular dislike for dwarves, kobolds, and others who make their living mining mountains.",
    "Mountain Nymph: The pitiless eyes of this elven creature are black as pitch with neither white nor iris._  \n**Born to Hunt.** Mountain nymphs claim to be the children of gods associated with hunting and the moon. Whether this is true or not is unknown, but they are renowned as being some of the best stalkers and trappers among the fey. Newly created mountain nymphs, wearing leathers and carrying yew bows, form on the mountainside, fully-grown. The nymphs carry no arrows; every time they put a finger to any bowstring, a nocked arrow appears.  \n**Despoilers of Despoilers.** Mountain nymphs despise mortals who disrupt the natural order. Those who take or use more natural resources than they need while in a mountain nymph\u2019s territory risk becoming the target of her wrath. The raising of a settlement in a mountain nymph\u2019s territory will attract her immediate attention. The ruins of a failed mountain settlement may be the work of a mountain nymph that has taken umbrage at the community\u2019s excessive use of the local timber and ore.  \n**Relentless Stalkers.** Little can be done to deter a mountain nymph once it has set its sights on a quarry. They have been known to track their prey far from their native mountains, across continents and into mortal cities. When a nymph catches up to her mark, she harries it without mercy or remorse. A nymph\u2019s mark, assuming it has done nothing to offend or harm the nymph, can throw the nymph off its tail by exiting her territory and leaving tribute of freshly hunted meat and strong drink.",
    "Mountain Strider: These large creatures stand upright, with exceptionally powerful legs that end in cloven hooves. Their upper bodies are muscular beneath their snowy-white fur, and their heads resemble those of goats._  \n**Dwellers of Mountains.** Mountain striders are most at home in the mountains. They live among the peaks, climbing seemingly impossible slopes to make their homes in the caves and burrows they dig near the tops. Ages ago, they had amicable relations with nearby settlements, but their aggressive behavior and boorish attitudes led to conflicts with the populace. They were subsequently made to withdraw from civilization as a result. In the years since, they have become an insular people, fearful of outsiders and resentful of civilization.  \n**Communal.** Mountain striders live in communal groups that travel the mountains, moving with the seasons. They are highly protective of each other and go into a brief rage when one of their number falls. Their nomadic and overly protective natures occasionally bring them into conflict with dwarves, though the two don\u2019t actively hunt each other.  \n**Bleating Communication.** The weather on the highest mountain peaks can turn at a moment\u2019s notice, separating family groups within minutes. The mountain striders adapted to such dangers by developing complex bleating calls. Over time, these calls became part of the mountain striders\u2019 culture, seeing use outside of emergency situations. The calls range from simple notifications of an individual\u2019s location or health to short songs identifying family affiliation and lineage.",
    "Murgrik: This reptilian creature is built like an alligator with two extra mouths: one affixed to a stalk between its eyes and one toothy maw stretched over its belly. A batlike membrane connects its forelimbs to its body, and a tail made up of a dozen spinning tentacles propels the abomination in flight._  \n**Marshy Nightmares.** Murgriks are consummate hunters and prefer to prey on intelligent creatures. They relish the fear their appearance provokes, and they augment this fear by generating terrifying wails from the stalks on their heads. Once they smell blood, they relentlessly attack and pursue prey until they or their prey die.  \n**Corrupted Alligators.** Occasionally, deep parts of swamps cross planar boundaries into the Abyss. Those who study murgriks believe the creatures are ordinary alligators warped by their proximity to that plane. Their cruelty and preference for intelligent prey both lend credence to the notion that the Abyssa has influenced their mutations.  \n**Afraid of Herons.** The only known way to deter a murgrik from attacking is to introduce a heron, real or illusory. The reason a murgrik retreats from herons is a mystery, but it may point to the existence of a demonic bird that preys on murgriks.",
    "Mydnari: This tall, lanky humanoid is sightless, its eyes nothing more than useless spots in its otherwise human face. The creature is encased in a sheath of thick orange jelly, almost as if it had been dipped in a giant pot of honey. The jelly wobbles and slides over the creature\u2019s body as if alive._  \n**Sightless Alchemists.** The mydnari are an eyeless, evil subterranean race that lives alongside oozes. They delight in capturing other creatures and using the creatures for experimentation or as food for their colonies of oozes and slimes. They constantly experiment with new serums, tonics, and concoctions, striving to always improve themselves and their connection with their oozes.  \n**Bound in Jelly.** Each mydnari enters into a symbiotic relationship with a mutated strain of Open Game License",
    "Myling: _Mylings are the souls of the unburied, those who died in the forest from abandonment or exposure and can find no peace until their bodies are properly interred. Given the circumstances around their deaths, mylings tend to be solitary. They haunt the places where they died. When some tragedy resulted in multiple deaths, the resulting mylings stay together and hunt as a pack._  \n**Attack in a Rage.** Mylings prefer to attack lone wanderers, but they target a group when desperate or when there\u2019s more than one myling in the pack. They shadow a target until after dark, then jump onto the target\u2019s back and demand to be carried to their chosen burial ground. They cling tightly to a victim with arms and legs locked around the victim\u2019s shoulders and midsection, begging, threatening, and biting until the victim gives in to their demands. Mylings will bite victims to death if they are unable or unwilling to carry them, or if a victim moves too slowly.  \n**Ungrateful Rest.** While all mylings seek a creature to carry them to their final resting place, even when a chosen \u201cmount\u201d is willing to carry the myling, the creature\u2019s body grows immensely heavier as it nears its burial place. Once there, it sinks into the earth, taking its bearers with it. Being buried alive is their reward for helping the myling.  \n**Urchin Rhymes and Songs.** Some mylings maintain traces of the personalities they had while alive\u2014 charming, sullen, or sadistic\u2014and they can speak touchingly and piteously. Dressed in ragged clothing, their skin blue with cold, they sometimes reach victims who believe they are helping an injured child or young adult. They hide their faces and sing innocent rhymes when they aren\u2019t screeching in fury, for they know that their dead eyes and cold blue skin cause fright and alarm.  \n**Undead Nature.** A myling doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Mystic: Dressed in clean, dark robes, its claws swirling in arcane gestures, the pale reptilian sends a bolt of energy from the Void at its foes._  \nSatarre mystics are creatures with tight awareness of nearby living creatures\u2019 fates. They rely on magic and the ability to speak words of decay to control lesser creatures. Mystics\u2019 minds are always turned to destruction and death, though they hold their own lives more dear than that of their fellow satarres, be they non-combatant drones, rampaging destroyers, or others.  \n**Easily Distracted.** Satarre mystics are known for their ability to ponder and cogitate on larger concerns, even in the midst of a conversation with strangers or a battle with foes. Sometimes these distractions lead them to a great insight and a clever countermove; other times they are easily surprised, captured, or fooled by a shining bit of magic or an unknown arcane device.  \n**Perpetual Incantations.** Satarre mystics seem to somehow maintain a steady stream of muttered sounds. Sometimes these take a brief physical form, such as a glowing rune of destruction that circles a mystic\u2019s head or drifts from its maker and falls apart in midair.  \n**Planar Lore and Tools.** Satarre mystics are well-versed in angelic, elemental, and fiendish magic and other arcana, although they do not perform all of these themselves. They often find and use magical items looted from their victims, or command elemental or fiendish minions using Void Speech.",
    "Naina: _These drakes are resplendent in their natural form, plumed and scaled in glittering, multicolored hues. In humanoid form, they appear as elderly homespun human crones or as young, beautiful elvish women._  \n**Drakes in Human Form.** These faerie drakes can take the shape of wise, old, human women. They retain full use of their sorcerous powers in their humanoid forms, and they can retain that form indefinitely.  \n**Difficult to Spot.** A naina shapeshifted into human form is nearly impossible to spot as anything but human unless she makes a mistake that gives away her true nature, and they seldom do. Draconic roars, a flash of scales, a fondness for raw meat, and a flash of wrathful dragon breath are the most common tells.  \n**Hunted by Rumor.** When rumors of a naina circulate, any woman who is a stranger may be persecuted, ostracized, or even tortured unless she can prove that she\u2019s entirely human.",
    "Naizu-Ha: The old fable How Nuizamo Lost His Knife suggests every blade that has been used to kill is actually a naizu-ha in its native form. This is untrue, but the naizu-ha enjoy the myth and perpetuate it whenever possible._  \n**Daggers Personified.** The naizu-ha are the act of violence perpetrated by small blades given form. Dealings with naizu-ha are fraught with danger. Initially presumed to be good allies in battle, it was quickly discovered that they couldn\u2019t be controlled in a pitched combat and eagerly lashed out at anything that came into reach. Most often, naizu-ha are summoned to assassinate specific targets.  \n**Impartial Betrayers.** A naizu-ha has no loyalty to anything but its own desire for blood and pain. If dispatched to kill someone, a naizu-ha can be coerced to switch sides with a promise that their new task will involve more violence than the current job does. They have no patience for subtle work or trickery that involves more than a quick feint. A favorite tactic of naizu-ha is to fulfill a contract, collect whatever payment has been agreed upon, and immediately murder the initial contractor.  \n**Bloody Biers.** To summon a naizu-ha, the blood of no fewer than three humanoids must be splashed on a stand forged of fused blades. If the petitioner uses their own blood in the ceremony, they have advantage on any ability checks they make to treat with the naizu-ha.  \n**Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesn\u2019t require food, drink, or sleep.",

Its mouth is filled with several rows of vicious teeth, and an ivory horn emerges from the top of its head._  \n**Aerial Predators.** A narshark is a creature that resembles a cross between a shark and a narwhal with dark blue skin, long serrated teeth, and a horn growing from its brow. Like many sharks, the narshark is a rapacious predator, hunting birds through the sky as a shark hunts fish. While it lacks the keen nose of most predators, the narshark has excellent eyesight and can pick out details at great distances. While narsharks are dangerous predators, they are seldom top of the aerial food chain and face fierce competition from Open Game License",
    "Nephirron Devil: This devilish monster has a draconic body covered in thick, greenish-gold scales and the head of a handsome giant with gleaming red eyes. It opens its mouth in a sardonic smile, and the head of a serpent appears between its lips, hissing with malevolent, mirthful relish._  \n**Devilish Infiltrators.** Nephirron devils are powerful fiends with draconic features that are adept at corrupting good-aligned dragons and bending evil dragons to their will. The older and more powerful the dragon, the bigger the challenge in the eyes of the nephirron devil. When two of these devils meet, they typically boast about the number and types of dragons they have manipulated and destroyed. This pride can also be a nephirron devil\u2019s undoing, however, for it often overlooks humanoids attempting to interfere with its plans, and more than one nephirron devil has been brought low by a band of mortal heroes.  \n**Hellish Nobles.** Nephirron devils are treated as lesser nobility in the hells, second only to pit fiends and arch-devils in the infernal pecking order. A nephirron devil is often served by Open Game License",

Ngobous are irascible and suspicious by nature, prone to chasing after any creature that stays too long inside its territory. They also become aggressive when they can see or smell elephants. Even old traces of elephants\u2019 scent are sufficient to trigger an ngobou\u2019s rage.  \n_**Poor Beasts of War.**_ Grasslands tribes sometimes try to train ngobous as beasts of burden or war, but most have given up on the ill-tempered animals; their behavior is too erratic, especially if elephants are nearby or have been in the area recently.  \n_**Trample Crops.**_ Ngobou herds can smash entire crops flat in minutes\u2014and their horns can tear through a herd of goats or cattle in little time as well.",
    "Nharyth: A hideous mass of coiling intestines undulates, ejecting thin, transparent spears of some resinous material from its many orifices. The creature makes a wet slithering sound as it moves unsettlingly through the air._  \n**Foulness in Motion.** The nharyth defies gravity with its every movement, as it pulls itself through the air with its mass of intestine-like appendages. The creature does not seem to possess any natural means of propulsion and can even fly through areas where there is no magic.  \n**Creations of Madness.** Most scholars believe nharyth were created in some insane magical experiment. Others believe they are the spawn of some yet-unknown horror between the stars. Whatever the case, they are clearly not part of the natural ecosystem.",
    "Nichny: _These ancient creatures resemble nothing so much as black cats dressed in sumptuous, if archaic, clothing._  \n**Xenophobic.** The nichny are highly xenophobic and gleefully carnivorous fey who dwell in deep, primeval forests.  \n**True and False Prophets.** They can dispense luck to those they like and they certainly have oracular powers, but they rarely share their prophecies with outsiders. Their prophecies are always delivered in triples, and legend holds that two inevitably prove true and one proves false.  \n**Answer Three Questions.** One final legend claims that if a nichny can be bound with gold or orichalcum chains, it must answer three questions. As with their prophecies, two answers will be true and one will be a lie. All three questions must be posed before any will be answered. When the third answer is given, the nichny and the chains disappear.",

Their howls are songs of vengeance, and their fangs and jaws seem ready to swallow the world._  \n**Champions of the Northern Packs.** Created in a magical ritual performed over a pregnant worg by her packmates, nightgarms are always female and are always loyal followers of Fenris. They are dedicated to harassing servants of the gods, especially the northern gods of the sky, thunder, or wisdom. Their spawn infiltrate settlements to bring them down\u2014treachery that always ends with a massed attack by wolves.  \n**Carry Off Plunder.** Nightgarms resemble enormous wolves, but up close their wide mouths, hate-filled eyes, and half-formed fingers give them away as something different from\u2014and much worse than\u2014 worgs. They can wield items in their front paws and can walk on their hind limbs when necessary, though they are far swifter on four legs.  \n**Impossibly Wide Jaws.** A nightgarm\u2019s jaws can open to swallow corpses, living creatures, and items larger than themselves, a magical trick that happens in a matter of seconds.",

Most grow their hair long, braiding colorful beads into their locks to mark important events in their lives. Although the nkosi\u2019s true form is that of a feline humanoid with leonine features, the most striking feature of the nkosi is their ability to change their shape, taking the form of a lion. Although comfortable in the wilds, nkosi can adapt to any environment.  \n**Clawlike Blades.** In combat, they favor curved blades, wielded in a brutal fighting style in concert with snapping lunges using their sharp teeth. They prefer light armor decorated with bone beads, fetishes, and similar tokens taken from beasts they\u2019ve slain.  \n**Pridelords.** Nkosi pridelords are exceptionally tall and muscular members of the race, and they are leaders among their kin.

Their skin is sallow and gaunt even before they smear it with ash, bone dust, and worse materials to wash all living color from their bodies. The noctiny embrace all manner of blasphemous and taboo behaviors to please their masters.  \n**Pyramid of Power.** The noctiny\u2019s lust for power drives them away from decency and reason. They are initiates who form the lowest rung of fext society. They swear themselves into service to the undead fext as thugs, servants, acolytes, and cannon fodder, and in exchange draw a trickle of power for themselves.  \n**A Race Apart.** Though they arise from any humanoid stock, the noctiny are corrupted by the powers they serve. Noctiny retain the cosmetic traits that identify their original race if one looks hard enough, but any connection they once had to their fellows is overpowered by their transformation into noctiny.",

Once set loose, these horrors attain a form of distributed self\u2011awareness. Exactly what motivates them is unknown, except that they are driven to survive.  \n**Flesh Stealers.** A weakened oculo swarm can reinvigorate itself by tearing fresh eyes from almost any type of living creature.

It can travel only 100 feet away from the main swarm, and it must return to the swarm within an hour or it dies.",
    "Ogrepede: The ogre steps forward with a lop-sided gait. As it approaches, it rises up, revealing it is actually an abomination of ogre torsos held together by necromantic power._  \nSpecial torments await the depraved souls that devised these unholy, undead amalgamations. An ogrepede is comprised of an unknown number of ogre torsos and heads stitched together, with arms erupting from the mass seemingly at random. Watching it skitter haphazardly about a battlefield is almost hypnotic, right until it reaches its prey and rises to attack.  \n**Vicious Louts.** Mixing and animating ogre parts does nothing to improve their legendary tempers. Even more so than ogres, ogrepedes seek out things to destroy. The more beautiful the creature or object, the more satisfaction the ogrepede derives from its destruction. The lair of the rare ogrepede that has slipped its master\u2019s bonds is full of its debased treasures and, in some instances, the mutilated but still-living victims of their assaults.  \n**Noisy Wanderers.** People are rarely surprised by the arrival of an ogrepede. Unless specifically commanded not to by their creator, ogrepedes emit a constant haunting moan, as though the creature laments all it has lost. Even if told to be silent, ogrepedes are not quiet. Their fat fingers drum noisily at the ground and their bodies slam gracelessly into corridor walls as they careen along on their duties.  \n**Poor Allies.** Ogrepedes have difficulty getting along with other creatures, including other ogrepedes. Vestiges of the craven instincts the ogres possessed in life remain after death, causing the ogrepede to lash out at any creature near it, particularly if the target is already wounded. Even when commanded to work with other creatures by their masters, it is merely a matter of when, not if, an ogrepede will attack its companions; the betrayal is inevitable.  \n**Undead Nature.** An ogrepede doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "One-Horned Ogre: This towering ogre is covered in rippling muscles. It wears a suit of burnished scale mail and hefts a gleaming greatsword in its hands. A large white horn emerges from the ogre\u2019s forehead, glowing with a strange blue radiance._  \n**Ogre Royalty.** A one-horned ogre is not only physically more impressive than other ogres, it also radiates a terrible majesty that causes most other ogres to supplicate themselves before it. Even creatures like Open Game License",
    "Onyx Magistrate: This large onyx statue looks down critically from an ornate chair. It wears long ceremonial robes and carries a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other. With a slow grinding sound, the statue animates and rises in the air, still seated in its onyx chair._  \n**Grand Sculptures.** Built to oversee great libraries, courts of law, royal houses, and the seats of government in corrupt and evil lands, onyx magistrates are intelligent constructs resembling judges, court officials, or bishops seated on massive thrones. The onyx magistrate is often placed in an area of importance such as within a great meeting hall or next to an important gate and remains motionless until it deems someone worthy of its attention or in need of punishment.  \n**Judge, Jury, and Executioner.** Onyx magistrates pursue their tasks with diligence and patience, never shirking from their responsibilities or showing pity or remorse for their actions. They never tolerate falsehoods or those seeking to cajole or intimidate them, though they have a soft spot for flattery, especially that which praises their abilities or dedication to their role. The construction of an onyx magistrate requires the binding of a Open Game License",
    "Oozasis: _The oasis appears as an idyllic desert respite, offering water, shade, and even perhaps edible fruit and nuts in the trees above._  \n**Mockmire.** The oozasis, or oasis ooze, is also known as a mockmire in other climates. It mimics a peaceful, pristine watering hole to draw in unsuspecting prey. An oozasis cycles seemingly at random between wakefulness and hibernation.  \n**Quest Givers.** Within its odd physiology stirs an ancient mind with an inscrutable purpose. Far from being a mere mindless sludge, its fractured intelligence occasionally awakens to read the thoughts of visitors. At these times, it tries to coerce them into undertaking quests for cryptic reasons.  \n**Ancient Minds.** Some tales claim these creatures preserve the memories of mad wizards from dead empires, or that they have unimaginably ancient, inhuman origins.",
    "Ophidiotaur: This creature could be mistaken for a large centaur if not for the black and green scales covering its body and its cobra-like head. Its hiss sounds like a hundred angry vipers, and the venom dripping from creature\u2019s long fangs sizzles as it lands._  \n**Born from Corruption.** An ophidiotaur is created when a centaur is transformed via a foul ritual that combines its form with that of a venomous serpent. Most centaurs do not survive the process, but those that do can reproduce naturally, potentially creating even more of these serpentine monstrosities.  \n**Servants of Serpents.** Ophidiotaurs serve evil nagas, Open Game License",
    "Ophinix: This bat-like creature has luxurious blue fur covering every part of its body. It has a heavily wrinkled face, large, bulbous eyes, and twin horn-like antennae. Thin sable wings unfurl from its back, and its fur emits tiny sparks of blue lightning._  \n**Cave-Dwelling Hunters.** A large, bat-like monstrosity native to many natural cave systems and chasms, the ophinix spends most of its time flying through the darkened passages of its home looking for its next meal. The ophinix is single-minded in its pursuit of prey, hunting bats, Open Game License",
    "Ophio Fungus: Row after row of bruise-purple fungus grows from the rocks like living shelves. The air becomes hazy as the fungus lets out a sudden puff of spores._  \n**Ambitious Parasite.** The ophio fungus is native to the subterranean caverns that wind through Leng, but it has no intention of remaining solely in its native world. The fungus seeks to infect as many carriers as possible to distribute itself across many planes and worlds.  \n**Mind Control.** The fungus attempts to infect carriers by issuing clouds of microscopic spores. Once inhaled, these spores attack the victim\u2019s brain, sapping their willpower and eventually leaving the victim under the control of the fungus.  \n**Master Plan.** Once a victim is infected with ophio spores, it is entirely under the control of the fungus, connected to the parent fungus by a psychic link that even reaches across planes. The fungus uses these victims to carry pieces of itself to other places or to lure more victims into its caverns.",
    "Orniraptor: A clumsy-looking flightless bird with a short, conical beak and no feathers or skin stares blankly with its single eye. Its organs are held in place by a slimy, transparent membrane._  \n**Nearly Mindless.** Orniraptors are creatures of pure instinct and share more in common with the basest vermin than with beasts. They attack anything that moves and peck off bits and pieces of their prey as they hunt, gobbling bites as it flees.  \n**Troublesome Pests.** Orniraptors tend to be more troublesome than dangerous, due to their persistence in striking at anything that moves. However, the creatures are capable of sharing their perceptions when near each other. This makes them particularly deadly when one notices something move and dozens of orniraptors suddenly converge on that point.  \n**Quiet Yet Loud.** Orniraptors have no vocal organs and simply squawk soundlessly as they go about their business. Their movements tend to be jerky and clumsy, though, and therefore quite audible.",
    "Orobas Devil: _Tall and powerful, this creature resembles a strong man with well\u2011chiseled muscles, save its equine head, flaring nostrils, and hoofed feet._  \nThe orobas thrive in Hell, selling their knowledge to those who have the coin (or other form of payment). The common phrase, \u201cnever trust a gift horse,\u201d stems from these corrupting devils.  \n**Horse-Headed but Wise.** When called to the mortal world, they sometimes take the shape of a destrier. Orobas devils prefer to take the horrific form of a horse-headed man. Sulfuric smoke curls from their nostrils and their fingers sport ragged claws. This beast\u2011like appearance belies their true strength; the orobas possess an uncanny knowledge of the past, as well as of things to come.  \n**Masters of Deceit.** When bargaining with an orobas, one must speak truthfully\u2014or possess an exceptionally quick tongue and the most charming smile. Practitioners of the dark arts know these devils as the Lords of Distortion, for their ability to practice deceit. They prize reality-warping magic above all else, and bribes of that sort can win concessions when making a pact.  \n**Surrounded by Lessers.** Orobas devils gather lesser devils both as chattel and defense. Their analytical minds telepathically confer the strengths and weaknesses of foes to their allies. With surprising speed, the deceivers can assess a battlefield, weigh outcomes, and redirect forces. Enemies of the orobas almost never catch them off guard. They have frequent, clear visions of their immediate future.",
    "Orphan of the Black: Appearing to be an unkempt human child between the ages of six and ten, this creature has bare feet and long, ragged, dirty nails. The matted mop of hair upon the creature\u2019s head has the odd blade of grass stuck in it. Its face is gaunt, with black, expressionless eyes, and its mouth is twisted into a sneer._  \n**Neglectful Beginnings.** Once children of the Material Plane, these poor souls were mistreated by their guardians or people in positions of authority. Through their sadness and neglect, they inadvertently opened doorways to the Shadow Realm, and, eager for an escape from their lives, they stepped through the doorways. Over time, the atmosphere of the Shadow Realm corrupted and twisted these children into feral creatures. Orphans of the black carry no weapons or belongings, except for a single tattered blanket or broken toy.  \n**Problem with Authority.** Orphans of the black hate those who hold command over others. Whenever possible, creatures prominently displaying rank or other titles, along with those who issue orders. An orphan of the black may sympathize with a creature that feels belittled or neglected, and it might forgo attacking the creature to attempt to coerce the creature into becoming an orphan of the black as well.",
    "Ortifex: A large, rotting heart floats forward, its hypnotic heartbeat echoing all around it._  \n**Vampiric Hunters.** An ortifex\u2019s singular purpose is to absorb blood from living creatures. When seeking blood, it disorients victims with an ominous, hypnotic heartbeat, then magically siphons their blood, leaving behind a shriveled carcass.  \n**Harvested from Giants and Dragons.** Only large hearts can be made into ortifexes, which are typically created from the hearts of giants, dragons, and particularly large beasts. Necromancers who create ortifexes for vampiric clients pay well for a sizeable heart, especially if it is minimally decomposed.  \n**Agents of Oppression.** When a blood cult, necromancer, or intelligent undead wants to demoralize a village or demand a sacrifice, it often sends an ortifex to collect payment in blood.  \n**Undead Nature.** An ortifex doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Ostinato: _A bit of catchy, repetitive music emanates from nowhere, drifting and moving as if dancing in the empty air._  \n**Born from Drama.** Incredibly moving arias, passionate performances, and ditties that drive you mad are often the product of ostinatos. These creatures of living music are born from overwrought emotions, and they feed off the vitality and personality of mortals.  \n**Song Searchers.** Ostinatos wander the mortal world as repetitive snippets of song, searching for hosts and rich feeding grounds. They enter hosts secretly, remaining undetected to prolong their voracious feasting as long as possible.",
    "Otterfolk: Brown fur covers the entire surface of this humanoid, which also has the black nose and small ears of an otter. Its piecemeal leather armor and weapon at the ready give the impression it is prepared for a fight._  \n**Foe to Reptilians.** While generally peaceful creatures, otterfolk bear an enmity for reptilians, owing to their near extinction in the jaws of giant alligators and other large swamp predators. They are wary of intelligent reptilian creatures, such as lizardfolk and naga, who regularly prey on their people. Otterfolk pass this animosity on to future generations through tales of heroic otterfolk overcoming ferocious snakes and mighty alligators. From the time an otterfolk kit can walk, it learns how to wield the atlatl and to be mindful of the presence of their hated foes. Otterfolk are wary of reptilian visitors or those accompanied by reptiles, but they are cordial to all others.  \n**Swamp Guides.** Otterfolk are excellent sources of information about the territory surrounding their homes, and they often escort friendly visitors through the swamp. The price for this service depends on the combat capabilities of those they escort. Their overwhelming martial outlook causes them to value visitors who can prove themselves in combat. If a group seems capable of protecting itself, the otterfolk reason they don\u2019t have to defend the group in addition to guiding it. They often ask such groups for a pittance in rations or monetary value (preferring pearls to other valuable items). Otterfolk greatly increase their fees for groups apparently incapable of fighting off potential swamp hazards. However, they pride themselves on never abandoning their charges.  \n**Otter Trainers.** Otterfolk often raise river otters as guard animals and pets, which serve the same function in their society as dogs in human societies. Otterfolk regard the animals warmly and become sad when favored pets die. They rarely allow their otters to engage in combat. They regularly hold contests where otter owners show off their training prowess by directing their otters in feats of strength, cunning, and dexterity. These contests never involve pitting the otters against each other in combat. The rare few otterfolk who choose to become wizards take otters as familiars. Otterfolk rangers often raise larger river otter specimens (use the statistics of a Open Game License",
    "Overshadow: Several humanoid silhouettes reach out with dark claws. The light shifts, revealing that they are connected to each other by a great mass of flowing darkness._  \nWhile common Open Game License",
    "Owl Harpy: _This winged woman\u2019s face is wreathed in a headdress of feathers; her luminous eyes and aquiline nose lend beauty to her feral demeanor. Her sharp, taloned feet seem even more inhuman by comparison._  \n**Harpy Queens.** An owl harpy is a queen among her kind, possessing superior grace and intelligence and an owl's predatory instinct and savage appetite. Owl harpies never grow hair, only feathers, which often wreathe their faces and crown their heads like a headdress. Their taloned feet are strong and razor sharp. They are much stronger fliers than lesser harpies; they swoop and hover in mid-air with ease to tear their prey apart. They are found in temperate climates as well as in deserts and jungles.  \n**Noctural Magic.** Owl harpies practice a rare, potent magic associated with darkness and the night. They can counter most light sources easily. So refined is their hearing that neither darkness nor invisibility detracts from their ability to hunt their quarry. Their acute hearing also means that thunder attacks distress them.  \nOwl harpies are natural (if irredeemably evil) bards thanks to their sharp wits. Less common but not unheard of are owl harpy oracles, scholars, and collectors. These savants are known to exchange their knowledge and insights for companionship or for unusual gifts and treasures.",
    "Pal-Rai-Yuk: This lengthy, two-headed, serpentine creature has three dorsal fins and six legs._  \n**Degenerate Dragons.** Pal-rai-yuks were once a species of underwater dragons. In their arrogance, they angered a sea deity who cursed them. To escape the deity\u2019s wrath, they adapted to tunnel through the earth, though they occasionally still seek prey in the water.  \n**Forgotten Meals.** By some quirk of the pal-rai-yuk\u2019s divine transformation, creatures it swallows can see outside of its stomachs, but the creatures aren\u2019t visible to those outside the pal-rai-yuk. Additionally, this quirk allows the serpents to erase their victims from others\u2019 memories, leaving victims with a deep sense of isolation as they are slowly digested.  \n**Endlessly Hungry.** The sea god segmented their stomachs in an attempt to curb their voraciousness. Unfortunately, it made them more gluttonous. This gluttony occasionally draws the attention of powerful humanoids or large armies. When this happens, the pal-rai-yuk quickly consumes anything it can catch, then digs deep into the earth where it hibernates for years, avoiding retaliation.",
    "Pale Screamer: This horrible, milk-white creature has the lower body of an emaciated humanoid and the upper body of a slimy jellyfish. Dark blue eyespots cover its upper body, and long, frilled, translucent tentacles trail from its frame-like tassels._  \n**Wailing in the Depths.** Adventurers traveling deep beneath the earth or in the ocean depths sometimes hear an unholy sound echoing toward them out of the blackness, followed by the sight of a creature that is neither human nor jellyfish. This is generally their first and last encounter with the pale screamer, a creature that haunts caves and waterways searching for victims to consume or transport back to the lairs of their terrible alien masters. The pale screamer pursues its mission with malicious relish and enjoys eating its prey alive, often in front of its victims\u2019 paralyzed companions.  \n**Evil Blooms.** Though pale screamers are artificial creatures and do not breed naturally, their masters sometimes form them into blooms of two or more for mutual cooperation and protection. These pale screamers learn to communicate with one another by changing the coloration of their eyespots, allowing them to transmit information silently and better ambush or mislead their foes.  \n**Formerly Human.** Pale screamers are created by mixing human and jellyfish-like creatures together using twisted, magical surgery. Most are the result of experimentation by Open Game License",
    "Paper Drake: _With its sharp angles and translucent skin, this draconic creature looks as if it were carefully folded from a massive sheet of paper, including its razor-sharp claws and teeth._  \n**Book and Map Erasers.** These drakes originated in exotic lands far away, where paper is as common as parchment and vellum. They now inhabit wide stretches of the world, and they seem to have edited their origins out of history.  \nPaper drakes are a bane to historians and spellcasters because they can erase ink and pigments, and they often do so at random simply for aesthetic purposes. They adore the possibility of a blank page, but they also sometimes erase one selectively to make beautiful patterns in the remaining ink.  \n**Correcting Errors.** Some paper drakes have a compulsion to correct errors in text or speech, and in these cases their strange ability isn\u2019t a nuisance. Indeed, these paper drakes help scribes correct mistakes, update outdated text, or erase entire volumes so they can be hand-lettered again with different text.  \n**Tattoo Magicians.** Paper drakes are sometimes subjected to strange magical rituals in which wizards tattoo powerful runes and symbols onto their skin. Those who survive this process gain even stranger, esoteric abilities, such as the ability to \u201cstamp\u201d text or images with their feet, the ability to make illustrations move as if alive, or even the ability to erase the memory of written words from a person\u2019s mind, much as they erase text from a page.  \nIn their regular form, paper drakes reach just over four feet in length and weight around 30 lb. They are usually white or tan, but develop a brown or yellow tone as they age.",
    "Parzz\u2019val: Six legs, ending in massive, three-fingered humanoid hands, support a headless horse-like torso. The front of this creature\u2019s mass opens into a huge tripartite maw filled with jagged, web-shrouded ridges dripping a caustic substance._  \n**Bottomless Hunger.** Parzz\u2019vals have enough intelligence to reason and problem solve, but they are largely guided by their monstrous appetites. Parzz\u2019vals prefer live prey but are not above eating carrion if their preferred meal isn\u2019t available.  \n**Ambush Hunters.** Despite their enormous hunger, parzz\u2019vals are excellent at taking their prey by surprise. A parzz\u2019val can wait patiently for hours for the ideal time to strike if they anticipate a meal awaits as a reward.",
    "Peat Mammoth: This pile of rotting plant matter is shaped similarly to a woolly mammoth, without the tusks. The plants forming its hide droop to the ground._  \n**Elephantine Plant Mound.** The peat mammoth is a mobile peat bog on four, stumpy legs. The plants draping from it give it the shaggy appearance of a wooly mammoth. It can extrude parts of its plant mound to strike at foes, but it mostly ambles over prey, absorbing them into its mass.  \n**Spirit-infused.** Peat mammoths are mounds of plant material inhabited and driven by the souls of intelligent creatures that died in peat bogs. The restless spirits steer the mammoth\u2019s movements, but the jumble of trapped souls leaves the mammoth without a true pilot or goal. Thus, the plant matter shambles onward, absorbing creatures and plants in its path, driven by the energy of spirits seeking release yet unable to find it.  \n**Swamp Gas Hazard.** The rotting plant and animal material contained within the peat mammoth\u2019s mass give off flammable swamp gases. The mammoth\u2019s saturated body gives it a measure of protection from fire, but the gases escaping from it easily catch fire. In rare instances, attacking the mammoth with fire results in a terrible explosion.",
    "Pestilence Swarm: These flying insects are coated in a thick layer of dust and cover the walls, ceiling and floor of a room, completely motionless in the dark. The stray light from a lantern falls one of them, awakening the swarm, which takes to the air in an angry fury._  \n**Awakened by Light.** The pestilence swarm is a massive group of tiny flying insects resembling enormous, fat houseflies. The smell of carrion often lures them underground or into shallow caves, though they also dig burrows. As long as they are in darkness, they are immobile, appearing almost dead. When hit by light, however, they awake and swarm any creatures in the area.  \n**Destroyer of Crops.** Although fortunately rare, when a cloud of these insects descends on a field, it takes mere hours for them to completely devour everything that might have been worth harvesting. They eat fruits, grains, and even the livestock, leaving a decimated field in their wake.  \n**Bringer of Plagues.** Pestilence swarms often carry and transmit disease as they move from area to area. They descend on populated areas, eat any food that is left out, bite the people who live there, and eventually move to the next area. Diseases from one area spread to another, festering in the bite wounds left by the swarm. The suffering they bring to small villages and towns is legendary.",
    "Phase Giant: This immense humanoid is covered in dark, spiny, chitinous skin, and its sizeable fists are rough and decorated with sharp spikes._  \n**Natural Carapace.** The phase giant has naturally hard skin, similar to that of a giant insect. Its face, hands, and joints are articulated and overlapping, allowing it to move freely beneath its hardened skin. The carapace grows into spikes in numerous places throughout its body, which it uses against captured prey and to aid it in climbing.  \n**Highly Mobile.** Deep caverns can be difficult to navigate with their twists and tight squeezes. The phase giant overcomes this by sliding into the Ethereal Plane and passing through the solid stone.  \n**Familial.** Phase giants are smaller than the average hill giant, but they more than make up for it in their ferocity. They are aggressive toward others, but not actually evil, tending to view most they encounter as mere annoyances. They are usually found in small family units of up to four, but rarely band together in larger groups.",
    "Phase Spider: A **phase spider** possesses the magical ability to phase in and out of the Ethereal Plane. It seems to appear out of nowhere and quickly vanishes after attacking. Its movement on the Ethereal Plane before coming back to the Material Plane makes it seem like it can teleport.",
    "Pine Doom: A living pine tree festooned with pinecones featuring razor-sharp edges looks balefully at the intrusion upon its solitude._  \n**Gruff Forest Protector.** Pine dooms are typically the largest plants in their groves, towering over ordinary pine trees. They see themselves as responsible for the wellbeing of their forests. They manage the growth of trees under their protection, clear out underbrush, and kill destructive vermin, allowing their groves to prosper. They have an inborn distrust of humanoids, but if a creature entering their forests seems genuinely in trouble, pine dooms allow them to seek shelter. They retaliate strongly, however, if someone takes advantage of their charity.  \n**Mobile Groves.** Similar to Open Game License",
    "Pixie\u2019s Umbrella: A Dozens of flat, purple-capped mushrooms float and spin through the air._  \nHuge colonies of pixie\u2019s umbrellas inhabit the Underworld. When they sense danger, they fill their caps to gain height then release the air, using the flattened caps to slow their descent.  \n**Migrating Fungus.** Their ability to float allows pixie\u2019s umbrellas to make homes on hard-to-reach surfaces, frustrating those who enjoy the mushrooms\u2019 bitter flesh. The ground beneath wall- and cliff-dwelling pixie\u2019s umbrellas is sometimes littered with the skeletal remains of starving travelers who fell in their desperate attempts to gather food.  \n**Dizzying Drifters.** Witnessing the migration of a colony of pixie\u2019s umbrellas can be fascinating to those who enjoy watching large numbers of the mushrooms float from cavern to cavern. Intelligent Underworld hunters sometimes use the migration of pixie\u2019s umbrellas to mask their approach, counting on the display to distract their prey.",
    "Plague Spirit: A tight, leather coif underneath a cracked, black mask that resembles a long-beaked bird with hollow, black eyes obscures the face and head of this humanoid. Long, tattered, dark-green robes drape loosely over its form. An obsidian censer decorated in etchings of dead trees moves from hand to hand, green mist pouring forth with each swing as it performs a strange and eerie dance._  \nPlague spirits and their deadly mists have haunted the planes as long as life has existed. The path of death left in their wake is often mistaken as the result of a natural disaster. Many druids speculate that plague spirits are entropic forces that exist as the embodiment of the darker side of nature, curbing overgrowth and allowing new life to grow from the dead.  \n**Harbingers of Decay.** The presence of a plague spirit is always announced by a rolling front of sickly, green mist that spans several miles. The spirit can always be found at the center, performing an unsettling yet enchanting dance. As it dances, the censer it carries expels mist in all directions. Any living thing exposed to this mist slowly succumbs to decay. Whether turning a lush forest and its inhabitants into a dark, desiccated landscape or creating a silent ruin out of a bustling city, the presence of a plague spirit forewarns a massive loss of life.  \n**Drawn to Life.** Plague spirits are drawn to the densest collections of life in an area, and nothing seems to deter these spirits from their path.",
    "Pombero: _This squat little man has long limbs and skin the color of coal, and the backs of its hands and tops of its feet are covered in thick hair. Its face seems a bit too wide for its head, and its eyes gleam a little too brightly in the pale light._  \nPomberos are strange tricksters, born of shadows in the wild. At rest, they tend to adopt a squatting posture, which accentuates their too-long limbs. They shun bright light, though it doesn\u2019t harm them, and seek out shadows and half-light. For this reason, they are known as the Night People.  \n**Joy of Trespassing.** Pomberos take delight from creeping into places where they don\u2019t belong and stealing interesting objects. A pombero\u2019s lair is littered with trinkets, both commonplace and valuable. The blame for all manner of misfortune is laid at the pombero\u2019s hairy feet.  \n**Hatred of Hunters.** In contrast to their larcenous ways, pomberos take great umbrage over the killing of animals and the destruction of trees in their forests. Birds are particularly beloved pets, and they enjoy mimicking bird songs and calls most of all. Villagers in areas near pombero territory must be careful to treat the animals and trees with respect, and killing birds usually is a strong taboo in such areas.",
    "Possessed Pillar: _This ancient animal-headed pillar is engraved with weathered symbols from ancient empires._  \n**Animal Headed.** Possessed pillars are carved from enormous blocks of stone to look like animal-headed gods of ancient pantheons, or sometimes demonic figures of zealous cults. The most common are the jackal-faced and the ibis-headed variants, but pillars with baboon, crocodile, elephant, or hawk heads also exist.  \n**Hijacked by Cults.** Some such pillars are claimed by various cults, and carved anew with blasphemous symbols or smeared with blood, oils, and unguents as sacrificial offerings.  \n**Weapon Donations.** Priests claim the weapons stolen by the pillars and distribute them to temple guards or sell them to fund temple activities.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A possessed pillar doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Priest: **Priests** bring the teachings of their gods to the common folk. They are the spiritual leaders of temples and shrines and often hold positions of influence in their communities. Evil priests might work openly under a tyrant, or they might be the leaders of religious sects hidden in the shadows of good society, overseeing depraved rites. \nA priest typically has one or more acolytes to help with religious ceremonies and other sacred duties.",
    "Primal Oozer: This nightmarish quadruped has many wolf-like features\u2014including its physique, its powerful claws, and its lupine countenance\u2014but its hairless skin is a thick layer of bluish-white slime. Four tentacles ending in barbed tips protrude from its jawline, and its eyes glow red. It makes a sickening gurgling sound when it growls._  \n**Natives of the Swamp.** Primal oozers are amphibious natives to swamps and wetlands. They often make their lairs in the root systems of massive trees where the soil beneath has been washed away. They can also be found in flooded ruins, wet riversides, or in the water itself. They are savage, deadly, and delight in killing.  \n**Kinship with Mydnari.** Primal oozers have a natural kinship with Open Game License",
    "Prismatic Beetle Swarm: _A dazzling explosion of multicolored lights erupts from this cloud of flying beetles, flashing every color of the rainbow._  \n_**Flesh-Eating Beauties.**_ The depths of the jungle are filled with lethal wildlife, and prismatic beetles are superlative examples of this. These flesh-eating, venomous insects distract and subdue their prey with sparkling beauty even as they devour it alive. Individual prismatic beetles sparkle like precious gems in the light; tosculi traders, gnolls, and humans often incorporate their carapaces into decorative jewelry or utilize them as special components in enchantment and illusion (pattern) spells and items.  \n_**Hypno-Paralytic.**_ When swarming in the thousands, these beautiful bugs create a hypnotic cascade of glimmering hues capable of enthralling creatures. As they descend on their dazed prey, the beetles\u2019 bites slowly paralyze their victims while their toxins distract the mind with feelings of euphoria and delight.  \n_**Predator Partners.**_ Although carnivorous, prismatic beetles are not overly aggressive; they attack other creatures only when hungry or threatened. Even when they\u2019re not attacking, however, they can be a threat; more than one unwary traveler has stopped to admire what they thought was a docile swarm of prismatic beetles, and became captivated. The unfortunates are often killed and eaten by lurking jungle predator, as such animals know the beetles stun and confuse prey.",

    "Pustulent Shambler: Piles of dissolved bones, seemingly eaten away by acid, encircle this mound of quivering, pus-covered flesh._  \n**Dissolvers of Bone.** Crawling heaps of diseased flesh, pustulent shamblers possess a corrosive material that eats away at bone matter.  \n**Keepers of Macabre Larders.** Pustulent shamblers drag victims of bonerot to their lairs to feed on the boneless flesh. Though they idly devour their victims, they have enough awareness of potential retribution to keep a few corpses available to quickly heal themselves.  \n**Connected to Bonerot.** Pustulent shamblers have a preternatural link to the disease they inflict. This allows them to track escaping victims and be present when the disease overtakes their prey.  \n**Ooze Nature.** The pustulent shambler doesn\u2019t require sleep.",
    "Putrescent Slime: As a rat moves to an algae-filled pool of water to take a drink, the pool suddenly comes to life and devours the rat._  \nPutrescent slimes form in large pools of fetid water and are often mistaken for algae by neophyte explorers in the depths of the world.  \n**Pool Feeders.** Putrescent slimes lurk in dank pools, only attacking desperate creatures that drink from their homes. As their prey decomposes in the water, the putrescent slime slowly digests the disgusting morass.  \n**Ooze Nature.** A putrescent slime doesn\u2019t require sleep.",
    "Putrid Haunt: _These shambling corpses have twigs, branches, and other debris intertwined with their bodies, and their gaping maws often crawl with scrabbling vermin._  \n**Swamp Undead.** Putrid haunts are walking corpses infused with moss, mud, and the detritus of the deep swamp. They are the shambling remains of individuals who, either through mishap or misdeed, died while lost in a vast swampland. Their desperate need to escape the marshland in life transforms into a hatred of all living beings in death. They often gather in places tainted by evil deeds.  \n**Mossy Islands.** When no potential victims are nearby, putrid haunts sink into the water and muck, where moss and water plants grow over them and vermin inhabit their rotting flesh. When living creatures draw near, the dormant putrid haunt bursts from its watery hiding spot and attacks its prey, slamming wildly with its arms and stomping on prone foes to push them deeper into the muck. There\u2019s no planning and little cunning in their assault, but they move through the marshes more freely than most intruders and they attack with a single-mindedness that\u2019s easily mistaken for purpose.  \n**Leech Harbors.** Putrid haunts create especially favorable conditions for leeches. They are often hosts or hiding places for large gatherings of leeches.  \n**Undead Nature.** A putrid haunt doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Qiqirn: This strange dog is hairless except for the thick, dark fur that runs along its bony, ridged back._  \n**Arctic Legends.** Oral histories of the north are rich with tales of the qiqirn. The tales say they are drawn to mankind\u2019s warm hearths and homes and that the sounds of music and mirth enrage them. The stories note that qiqirn are jealous of dogs and that jealousy leads them to kill canines whenever they can. More than a few tales are told of qiqirn that have foolishly become trapped while trying to get at a settlement\u2019s sled dogs. Most importantly, northern children are told that a qiqirn can be driven off by shouting its name at it.  \n**Afraid of Civilization.** Feared as they are by northern communities, qiqirn fear those people in turn. When threatened by civilized folk, qiqirn are quick to flee. When this occurs, a qiqirn often returns by night to steal the food or livestock it was previously denied. When qiqirn attacks have driven an entire community to hunt it, the monster leaves the region for easier hunting grounds.  \n**Spirit Dog.** A qiqirn\u2019s fear of civilization is built on the basis of self-preservation.

    "Quickserpent: Muck covers this muscular snake, which seems more at home in the silt and water on the ground than among tree boughs._  \n**Earth Elemental Ancestry.** Formerly native to the Plane of Earth, quickserpents migrated to the Material Plane centuries ago because of a catastrophe that destroyed the area of the plane where they laired. The catastrophe also shunted the surviving serpents to swamps with connections to the Plane of  \n**Earth.** The creatures adapted to their new environments and lost many of their elemental traits. They still understand the language of earth elementals and typically avoid attacking the elementals. A handful of powerful elementals that remember the snakes have attempted to reintegrate them to the Plane of Earth with mixed results.  \n**Ambusher from Below.** A quickserpent, like many terrestrial constrictor snakes, ambushes its prey. However, it waits below the surface where it picks up the vibrations of creatures traveling above it. If the terrain is suitable, the serpent churns the ground into quicksand to pull unsuspecting prey into the earth. While its victim struggles to escape the mire, the serpent takes advantage of its prey\u2019s helplessness to wrap itself around and crush its prey. If the serpent manages to ensnare more than one creature, it targets the one with the most success emerging from the quicksand.",
    "Quipper: A **quipper** is a carnivorous fish with sharp teeth. Quippers can adapt to any aquatic environment, including cold subterranean lakes. They frequently gather in swarms; the statistics for a swarm of quippers appear later in this appendix.",
    "Quoreq: Vaguely humanoid in appearance, this creature has long, raking claws, a jerking gait, and no facial features. Its mushroom-gray skin is covered in strange bumps and eddies as if something were seething just below the surface._  \n**Faceless Nightmares.** Dwelling on the fringes of human society in abandoned buildings, polluted thickets, and grimy backstreets, the quoreq is an aberration born from human misery and squalor, an agglomeration of negative and vile thoughts given form and motion. Though not especially picky in their choice of victims, they are empathetically drawn to creatures experiencing some form of despair or pain.  \n**Emotionless Killers.** Quoreqs do not experience emotions the same way most humanoids do and have no concept of fear or love. They do not inflict pain for simple enjoyment, instead inflicting it to share in the experience such intense emotions can produce. As they inflict pain, they often telepathically ask their victims how it feels.  \n**Horrible Feeding.** Quoreqs eat and sleep like any normal creature, but, since their mouths are concealed beneath their rigid flesh, they must use their claws to rip open their own bodies to quickly gulp down food before they can regenerate. This unusual and horrific practice lends some support to the theory that quoreqs are wholly unnatural creatures born directly from human nightmares.",
    "Qwyllion: _These hideous, reeking creatures resemble toothless, cadaverous hags, their large eyes glowing with unearthly green light, and their fingers tipped with ragged claws._  \n**Twisted Nymphs.** Qwyllion (the name means \u201cpolluter\u201d in Old Elvish) are nymphs who have been twisted by the corrupted mana of magical wastelands or warped alchemical experiments into baleful versions of their former selves.  \n**Frighten Animals.** Besides making them hideously ugly, the transformation leaves them with a deadly gaze attack and the ability to dominate a living creature with a mere glance. Animals refuse to approach within 20 feet of them.  \n**Goblin Mercenaries.** Qwyllion and their dominated thralls and enslaved specters are sometimes engaged by goblin sorcerers and evil mages to guard desecrated temples and despoiled gardens. The terms and payments for these arrangements vary wildly from one qwyllion to the next. Anyone who dares to employ a qwyllion must be constantly vigilant, because these creatures are prone to renege on any agreement eventually.",
    "Radiant Spark Swarm: A large cloud composed of tiny glowing sparks of fire floats silently through the air._  \n**Origin of Planar Instability.** Radiant spark swarms form when the border lands between the Plane of Fire and the Upper Planes experience some sort of instability. This instability might be caused by a regional anomaly, war between the gods themselves, magical upheaval, or some other calamity. Thousands of radiant sparks are created at once in massive conflagrations of radiant energy. They are then left to wander the planes alone. These creatures are most often found in the border lands between planes, but they have been known to appear in the Material Plane after accessing it through magical portals. They seldom wander back to their planes of origin and are almost always destroyed at some point during their eternal wanderings.  \n**Hunger for Magic.** Radiant spark swarms are drawn to magic for reasons that aren\u2019t fully understood, for they can neither use it, nor do they truly devour it. Instead, when they sense powerful magic nearby, they instinctually move toward it, as though its very presence is comforting to them. As creatures that are neither particularly intelligent nor evil, their interest in the living usually has to do with the magic spellcasters carry, which draws the sparks close. Unfortunately, the owner of the magic that drew them is often caught in the midst of the swarm, which is inherently harmful.  \n**Elemental Nature.** A radiant spark swarm doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Ramag: _These few denizens of a blasted desert waste now huddle in the remains of an ancient city\u2014a city magically scattered across hundreds of miles._  \n**Once Human.** The ramag were a powerful tribe of dimensional sorcerers allied with a great society of titans, and they were indeed human in ages past. Over time, strange practices warped them into their current state, and they are clearly no longer purely human. Their limbs grow too long in proportion to their bodies, giving them a stooped, odd posture. Their features are angular, and a ramag\u2019s hair is impossibly thick; each strand is the width of a human finger. They wear their strange hair tied back in decorative clasps.  \n**Portal Network.** The ramag used their innate magical gifts to maintain powerful magical conduits, ley lines that crisscrossed the titan\u2019s empire. This mastery of arcane might allowed instantaneous travel to the farthest-flung outpost. The ramag still maintain a network of magical monoliths that connect the scattered districts of their home, but this network is frayed and fading.  \n**Studious and Powerful.** Although physically weak, the ramag are sharp-witted, studious, and naturally infused with magic. Lifetimes of exposure to the warping effect of their runaway magical energy have given the ramag innate control over magic, as well as sharp resistance to it. They are acutely aware of their responsibility for keeping magic in check, and fully know the danger of uncontrolled magical energies. Even the the lowliest ramag has a sharp intellect and a natural understanding of magic. Many ramag take up the study of wizardry. Few become wandering adventurers, but well-equipped expeditions sometimes leave their homeland to inspect the surrounding countryside.",
    "Rat King: _A great knot of scabrous rats scrabbles together as a mass, with skulls, bones, and flesh entangled in the whole. Teeth, eyes, and fur all flow as a single disturbing rat swarm walking on two legs._  \n**Fused at the Tail.** A rat king forms when dozens of rats twist their tails together in a thick knot of bone and lumpy cartilage. Its numbers and powers grow quickly.  \n**Rule Sewers and Slums.** The rat king is a cunning creature that stalks city sewers, boneyards, and slums. Some even command entire thieves\u2019 guilds or hordes of beggars that give it obeisance. They grow larger and more powerful over time until discovered.  \n**Plague and Dark Magic.** The rat king is the result of plague infused with twisted magic, and a malignant ceremony that creates one is called \u201cEnthroning the Rat King.\u201d Rats afflicted with virulent leavings of dark magic rites or twisted experiments become bound to one another. As more rats add to the mass, the creature\u2019s intelligence and force of will grow, and it invariably goes quite mad.",
    "Ratatosk: _Chattering creatures with a superficial similarity to squirrels, the ratatosk have tiny tusks and fur that shimmers in a way that defies the surrounding light._  \n**Sleek-furred Celestials.** The ratatosk is a celestial being that is very much convinced of its own indispensable place in the multiverse. Its fur is sleek, and it takes great pride in the cleaning and maintaining of its tusks.  \n**Planar Messengers.** Ratatosks were created to carry messages across the planes, bearing word between gods and their servants. Somewhere across the vast march of ages, their nature twisted away from that purpose. Much speculation as to the exact cause of this change continues to occupy sages.  \n**Maddening Gossips.** Ratatosk are insatiable tricksters. Their constant chatter is not the mere nattering of their animal counterparts, it is a never-ending celestial gossip network. Ratatosk delight in learning secrets, and spreading those secrets in mischievous ways. It\u2019s common for two listeners to hear vastly different words when a ratatosk speaks, and for that misunderstanding to lead to blows.",
    "Ratfolk: _Ratfolk are the size of halflings, though smaller in girth and quicker in their movements. At a glance they might even be mistaken for halflings if not for their twitching snouts, bony feet, and long, pink tails._  \nThe ratfolk are canny survivors, rogues and tricksters all. Their strong family ties make it easy for them to found or join criminal societies--though others serve as expert scouts and saboteurs, able to infiltrate army camps, city sewers, and even castle dungeons with equal ease. Ratfolk leaders are often spellcasters and rogues.  \n**Adaptable.** Ratfolk swim well and can survive on little. Some groups are endemic to tropical and subtropical islands. Others inhabit forests, sewers, labyrinths, and ancient, ruined cities.  \n**Fast Fighters.** Ratfolk prefer light weapons and armor, fighting with speed and using numbers to bring a foe down. They have been known to ally themselves with goblins, darakhul, and kobolds on occasion, but more often prefer to serve a \u201cRat King\u201d who may or may not be a rat of any kind. Such rat rulers might include a wererat, a rat king, an ogre, a minor demon or intelligent undead.",

Their heads are crowned by long-stemmed, green-paddled fronds and spiked seed pods, and their dangling arms end in hooked wooden talons._  \n**Leafy Advisors.** Tribal humanoids respect and venerate ravenelas, and sometimes seek their advice or magical aid at times of great need. Ravenalas seldom interact with other species unless approached and questioned.  \n**Prisoners Lamentation.** Unlike treants, ravenalas avoid physical conflict in favor of magical responses. If annoyed, they imprison hostile creatures within their trunks rather than killing or eating them. Trapped creatures must sing their own lament as they are carried off to a distant, dangerous locale. Ravenalas grow to about 20 feet tall and can weigh 1,800 lb.",
    "Ravenfolk Doom Croaker: _While a huginn\u2019s face resembles that of a great raven or crow, it lacks wings and has a much more solid frame. Most are pitch black, although a smattering have white feathers and red flecks._  \nThe ravenfolk are an avian race of scoundrels, schemers, and sneaks\u2014and they are much more than that. Long ago when Odin brokered the truce that brought peace among the gods, the wily deity magically created the ravenfolk from feathers plucked from his ravens Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Memory.) He placed this new race into the world alongside elves, dwarves, humans, and others to be his spies.  \n**Odin\u2019s Children.** To this day, the ravenfolk are Odin\u2019s agents and embody his thought and memory. They are thieves of objects, yes, but primarily, they are thieves of secrets. Their black feathers and long beaks are spotted on the road from place to place, trading information or helping to hatch plots. They are widely viewed as spies, informers, thieves, and troublemakers, but when the ravenfolk swear an oath, they abide by it.  \nOdin grants the best of his ravenfolk magical runespears and runestaves, two-handed heavy weapons enchanted to serve his messengers. These function as long spears or quarterstaves in the hands of other races. The ravenfolk consider them special tokens meant for their use, and no one else\u2019s.  \n_**Flightless but Bold.**_ Though they have no wings and normally cannot fly, the physiology of ravenfolk is strikingly similar to that of true avians. They stand roughly 5 ft. tall and, because of their hollow bones, weigh just 95-105 lb. Albino ravenfolk are found in southern climates.  \nRavenfolk eat almost anything, but they prefer raw meat and field grains, such as corn, soy, and alfalfa. They even scavenge days-old carrion, a practice that repulses most other humanoids.  \n_**Feather Speech.**_ The huginn have their own language, and they have another language which they may use as well: the language of feathers, also known as Feather Speech or Pinion. Ravenfolk can communicate volumes without speaking a word through the dyeing, arrangement, preening, and rustling of their plumage. This language is inherent to ravenfolk and not teachable to unfeathered races.",

    "Red-Banded Line Spider: _These spiders are named for both the deep red swirls on their abdomens, unique to each spider, and for their peculiar hunting technique. The largest ones hunt in the dark canopy of temperate and subtropical forests._  \n**Hand-Sized Hunters.** These furry, brown spiders are not enormous monsters, but they are big enough to be alarming. A typical one is as big as a human hand with fingers spread wide, but some grow as large as small dogs.  \n**Webbed Line.** Line spiders don\u2019t spin webs but instead perch and watch for prey. When prey wanders near, the spider launches a line of webbing to snare it, then pounces unerringly along that line to deliver a deep bite. Their potent venom can incapacitate creatures much larger than themselves, and they quickly devour flesh with their powerful jaws.  \n**City Dwellers.** Line spiders are often found in cities, and their size makes them a good replacement for a garroter crab in certain forms of divination. They\u2019re favorites among exotic-pet dealers\u2014usually with their venom sacs removed, sometimes not. Goblins, kobolds, and some humans use them rather than cats to control a mouse or rat infestation, and they make reasonably good pets if they\u2019re kept well-fed.

Few know anything about them, and the hags do little to enlighten them, preferring their seclusion.  \n**Tied to Nature.** The hags have a deep connection with all elements of nature, and they often make their homes in deep forests, in caves, or alongside coastlines.  \n**Blood Magic.** Because of their close connection to nature, red hags often serve as druids. Within their druidic circles, however, they practice blood sacrifices and perform ritualistic blood magic\u2014both to slake their craving for humanoid blood, but also as a means to venerate Hecate, goddesses of dark magic. Red hags also favor the cleric and wizard classes; few ever seek a martial path. The ancient hags all answer to a hierarchy.",

It grins with massive yellow teeth._  \n**Blood-Soaked Caps.** Redcaps are exceedingly dangerous creatures who wear the mark of their cruelty and evil quite literally. The caps from which they take their name define their existence, and they must constantly be revived with fresh blood.  \n**Compelled to Kill.** Redcaps aren\u2019t cruel and murderous by choice, but by necessity. A redcap must frequently bathe its cap in fresh, humanoid blood to sustain itself. If it fails to do so every three days, the creature withers and dies quickly. A redcap whose hat is nearly dry is a desperate, violent force of nature that prefers to die in battle rather than waste away to nothing.  \n**Bandits and Mercenaries.** Most long-lived redcaps are drawn to serve in marauding armies or make a living through constant banditry.",

When the noise grows shrillest, alien runes alight across its golden surfaces._  \n**Secret Keepers.** The people of Leng are renowned traders, and it once occurred to a Leng inventor that knowledge is the most valuable trade good. That inventor\u2019s identity is one of the many secrets the first repository faithfully keeps. These constructs are built for the reception, transmission, and safeguarding of information, and even those that don\u2019t hold particularly coveted information still defend their charges with lethal force. Repositories sometimes hold secrets within their consciousness, a task made easier by the fact that these creatures can understand all languages. Others hold physical recordings of information within their chest cavities.  \n**Master of Language.** A repository exists to protect and trade information, and as such, it knows and can translate all languages. Its programming allows it to wield this mastery of language as a physical weapon. A repository can also use the power of language as a psychic assault, uttering words of power to attack the very minds of its enemies.  \n**Right Tool for the Job.** The chest cavity of a repository contains an extradimensional space that functions like a bag of holding, granting the repository the ability to pull out any tool that may be required. Most repositories keep sets of common tools stashed inside their chests, including thieves\u2019 tools and smith\u2019s tools. Some repositories, however, are equipped with specialized tools or magic items, depending on the creatures\u2019 purpose at creation. Similarly, a repository can store anything it needs to protect in this extra-dimensional space. The repository is the only creature capable of retrieving items from this space while it is alive. When a repository is destroyed, its chest cavity becomes accessible to anyone that reaches inside its pyramidal form; however, the power holding this extra-dimensional space together fades after 1 hour. An object in the extra-dimensional space when it fades is destroyed.

Living creatures exposed to this incursion can undergo horrible mutations, turning into monstrous mockeries of their former shapes. One example of this phenomenon is the rift swine: once-ordinary pigs transformed into slavering horrors after being bathed in eldritch light.  \n**Destructive Herds.** Rift swine travel in herds of 5-8 (and larger herds are possible). Their effect on an area can be catastrophic\u2014they eat nearly anything, possess a fiendish cunning, and delight in the destruction they cause. A rift swine has difficulty perceiving anything smaller than itself as a threat, leading it to attack most other creatures on sight and fighting until it is destroyed.  \n**Abyssal Meat.** The rumors of vast herds of hundreds of rift swine on strongly chaos-aligned planes, cultivated by the lords of those places, are thankfully unconfirmed.",

It holds up its reflective shield, a disc-like extension of its metallic forearm._  \nTreasure hunters that pursue fiendish weapons of myth or enter temples to vicious entities may find themselves face-to-face with a righteous sentinel, eager to repel them.  \n**Keepers of Horror.** Good-aligned gods of peace have many methods for ensuring that defeated evils do not resurface in the future, and the righteous sentinel is one of their most effective. The constructs are placed as guards where great evil is housed to prevent anyone from accessing and awakening that which lies within.  \n**Abhors Violence.** Righteous sentinels seek to avoid violence as much as possible, but they react with unbridled rage when their ward is disturbed. When intruders disturb the objects of great evil the sentinels are protecting, the sentinel turns its reflective shield toward an intruder. The shield reflects a vision of that creature\u2019s soul back toward it, which is often enough to horrify even the most evil of monsters.  \n**Construct Nature.** The righteous sentinel does not require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

What\u2019s worse, its skin has been flayed off, revealing the dead muscle and sinew beneath._  \n**Spirt of War.** The risen reaver is an undead born from a warrior fallen on the battlefield. Its body becomes an avatar of combat, with four legs and a pair of long, heavy arms. In the process, it sheds its skin, becoming entirely undead muscle, bone, and sinew.  \n**Absorb Weapons.** When risen reavers take form, they absorb all weapons around them. Some of these weapons pierce their bodies, and others become part of the risen reaver\u2019s armament. Their four legs are tipped with blades on which they walk like metallic spiders. Their arms are covered in weaponry infused into their flesh, which they use to crush and flay any living creatures they encounter.  \n**Battle Mad.** Risen reavers are battle\u2011maddened spirits of vengeance and slaughter, obsessed with the chaos of combat that led to their own death. They hunt the living with the sole purpose of killing, and they thrive on violence and murder. As they died, so should others die.  \n**Undead Nature.** A risen reaver doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

    "Rock Roach: The insect clings to a large rock and drips saliva on it. A puff of steam rises from the rock, and the creature licks at the liquid remains, leaving a pockmark in the stone._  \n**Rock Eaters.** The rock roach is a giant cousin to the roach, and it feeds on rocks deep beneath the ground. It uses its proboscis to deposit acidic saliva onto the rock, breaking it down and lapping up the liquefied minerals. A rock roach\u2019s metabolism is slow to match its tedious eating process. Even still, a group of rock roaches can make quick work of a rocky wall, opening up routes between caverns. The roaches aren\u2019t concerned for structural integrity and their eating habits, if left unimpeded, often lead to cave-ins.  \n**Naturally Hostile.** Rock roaches are instinctually hostile to anything that wanders near them, including each other. The roaches mate annually, and the parents abandon the eggs shortly after laying them. Young rock roaches band together for the first few months of life, protecting each other as they devour the rock where they hatched, then dispersing once they are large enough to defend themselves.  \n**Valuable Carapace.** The carapace of a rock roach is sought after by some groups of underground humanoids. Naturally resilient and hard, craftsman harvest the carapace and slowly sculpt it into a suit of armor in a month-long process that requires regular boiling of the tough carapace.",

    "Rotting Wind: _A rotting wind brings a chilling gust to the air, turning nearby foliage to rot and raising a sense of dread in all creatures in its path._  \n**Air of Tombs.** A rotting wind is an undead creature made up of the foul air and grave dust sloughed off by innumerable undead creatures within lost tombs and grand necropoli.  \n**Scouts for Undead Armies.** A rotting wind carries the foul stench of death upon it, sometimes flying before undead armies and tomb legions or circling around long-extinct cities and civilizations.  \n**Withering Crops.** Rotting winds sometimes drift mindlessly across a moor or desert, blighting all life they find and leaving only famine and death in their wake. This is especially dangerous when they drift across fields full of crops; they can destroy an entire harvest in minutes.  \n**Undead Nature.** A rotting wind doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Rubezahl: _Resembling a black-furred stag that walks like a man, this creature has a pair of immense, branching antlers arching above its coldly gleaming eyes. The fur is sleek over most of its body, but becomes shaggy around its goatlike legs. The creature\u2019s hands are tipped with wicked claws, and its legs are goatlike with cloven hooves._  \n_**Assume Mortal Form.**_ Rubezahls are capricious creatures, driven by constantly shifting motivations and mannerisms. They are consummate tricksters who delight in taking the form of innocuous mortals like travelling monks, tinkers, or lost merchants. They love to play the friend with their nearly undetectable lies, slipping into the confidence of unsuspecting mortals before murdering them.  \n_**Counting Demons.**_ Rubezahls have a weakness, however. They are known as counting demons, and a savvy mortal who knows its nature can confound one with groups of objects: a handful of coins, a basket of apples, even a bed of flowers. If the objects are clearly pointed out to the rubezahl, the creature becomes distracted until it counts each item in the group. Unfortunately for mortals, rebezahls can count startlingly fast; even a mound of gravel takes no more than a few moments for a rubezahl to assess. Rubezahl loathe being compelled this way, and they are equally driven to annihilate any mortal bold enough to exploit this weakness.",

    "Runeswarm: A cloud of inky runes churns as some of the markings illuminate briefly._  \n**Untended Runes.** Runes that have gone unused for years or those created on ley lines sometimes gain a modicum of sentience and coalesce into a gestalt known as a runeswarm. The mix of runes flits about in random directions and remains inert except when it encounters living beings.  \n**Early Warning.** Runeswarms trigger their rune randomly, but the runes creating an effect light up moments before the swarms invoke the runes, giving canny observers the chance to prepare for the runeswarms\u2019 effects.",
    "Rusalka: _A barefoot woman with long hair and almost transparent skin sits upon a willow branch. Her hair and clothing are wet, as if she has just returned from a swim. Her smile seems friendly enough._  \nWhen a woman drowns, her dripping body may rise again as a rusalka. Some claim the drowning must be a suicide. Others say that the water itself must be tainted with murder or some great evil spirit.  \n**Near Water.** Rusalkas dwell in the water where they died, emerging only at night. Some climb a nearby tree, dangle their feet in the water, and sing alluring songs. Others sit on the bank, combing their wet tresses and awaiting prey. They must, however, remain in or near the water where they died, as part of their curse. However, during a full moon, the rusalki can leave the water to dance along the shore or the riverbank, singing all night long and inviting young men to join them.  \n**Songs and Poetry.** Rusalkas mesmerize and seduce passersby with song and dance and poetry. Young men are their usual victims, but they also prey on curious children, lonely older men, and other heartbroken women. When a potential victim comes near enough, the rusalki entangles the person with her hair and drags him or her beneath the water to drown.  \n**Lover\u2019s Walks.** A rusalka cannot pass for human on any but the darkest night, but she might claim to be a lonely tree spirit or a benevolent nymph willing to grant a wish in exchange for a kiss. She may part the water of a lake and coax her victim toward the center with the promise of a kiss\u2014delivered as her hair entraps the victim and the water rushes around him. Alternatively, she may use water walk so she and the victim can stroll across the surface of the water, reward him with a long kiss (to prevent him from catching a deep breath), then end the spell over deep water and drag him to the bottom.  \n**Undead Nature.** A rusalka doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Rust Drake: _A motionless rust drake is easily mistaken for a pile of scrap metal._  \n**Shedding Rust.** Aside from fangs and claws like iron spikes, this dragon-like creature seems to be nothing more than a collection of rust. Each beating of its wings brings a shower of flakes.  \n**Warped Metallics.** Many sages claim that rust dragons are a perversion of nature\u2019s order obtained either by the corruption of a metallic dragon\u2019s egg or the transformation of such a dragon by way of a ritual. Others disagree and propose another theory about a malady that affects the skin of young metallic dragons and ferrous drakes alike. So far, no one has discovered the truth about their origins.  \n**Filthy Scrap Metal Eaters.** These foul creatures feed on rust and are known as disease carriers.",
    "Salamander Monarch: Appearing as a well-muscled humanoid with the lower body of a serpent, this hideous yet strangely majestic creature is covered in thick, golden scales.

    "Salt Devil: _\u201cThey led that caravan without mercy or kindness. If you fell or stumbled, they struck you, making your tongue feel as sand or your body ache with pain, then laughed, telling you to get up. And once we arrived, gods, they had us take the tools from the dead, withered hands of the last slaves, and start digging.\u201d He took a drink from his waterskin, as if just the memory made him thirsty._  \n**Sparkly Crystals.** Salt devils have sharp, crystalline teeth, sparkling skin studded with fine salt crystals, and long claws that leave jagged, burning wounds. They can also fight with saltencrusted blades seemingly forged from thin air.  \n**Servants of Mammon.** Salt devils claim to serve Mammon, and they often ally with gnolls and slavers with whom they seek out oases to use as ambush sites or just to poison the water.  \n**Slavers and Corruptors.** Salt devils create slave markets and salt mines, where they thrive on the misery of those indentured into their service. They detest summoning peers during combat because they hate being indebted to another devil. They prefer to forge alliances with mortals when partners are needed for an endeavor, and they are less grasping and greedy than one might expect of Mammon\u2019s servants, preferring to encourage corruption in others.",
    "Salt Golem: _A salt golem is a crudely sculpted, roughly humanoid crystalline form that shuffles about on wide, stump-like feet. Tiny salt crystals fall from its body in a glittering cloud with every step._  \n**Coastal Druids.** These unnatural creatures are created by druids and others living in coastal or desert regions, or by those who seek to wage war with creatures susceptible to the warding powers of salt. Stories tell of a druid who built a squad of nine salt golems to combat a rampaging zmey. The salt warriors waged a long hunt and eventually killed the powerful dragon in its lair while the creator druid and her wizard companion reaped the spoils of its hoard.  \n**Crystalline and Silent.** A salt golem has a crudely formed humanoid body made of crystalline salts. It wears no clothing or armor and carries no weapons or other possessions. It cannot speak\u2014the only sound it makes is the susurrus of sliding sand as it moves. A salt golem is incapable of strategy or tactics. It mindlessly fights until it destroys its opponents or until ordered to stop by its creator.  \n**Valuable Remains.** A salt golem stands about eight feet tall and weighs around 1,000 lb. A salt golem\u2019s body is formed from a composite of at least 1,000 lb of rare salts and minerals worth at least 2,500 gp.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Sand Hag: _This withered crone glares malevolently, her face framed by lank gray hair. Her malicious grin is filled with shark teeth, and drool trickles from her lips._  \n**Hatred of Beauty.** Sand hags are terrifying crones that haunt desert ruins and forgotten oases. Their hatred for things of beauty and peace is terrible to behold. A sand hag uses her illusions and mimicry to lure travelers into an ambush.  \n**False Oasis.** They delight in tricking a caravan into an illusory oasis, killing all the riding animals and pack animals so the travelers can\u2019t flee, and then terrifying and slaughtering them one by one.  \n**Drain Bodies.** For the slaughter of animals or humanoids, a sand hag prefers to rely on her claws, which drain the moisture from their victims. They leave the mummified remnants in postures of life\u2014tied to a saddle, or atop a guard tower\u2014to terrify others.  \nSand hags stand 6 to 7 feet tall, weigh less than 150 lb., and dress in torn and tattered robes. Although skeletally thin, a sand hag\u2019s apparent frailty belies her prodigious strength.",
    "Sand Silhouette: _Sand silhouettes are spirits of those who died in desperation in sandy ground, buried during sandstorms, thrown into dry wells, or the victims of a dune collapse. Looking like a shadow stretched out along the ground, a sand silhouette\u2019s erratic movements are difficult to discern._  \n**Sand Bodies.** If disturbed or agitated, these restless souls cause the sand around them to swirl and form into a loose vortex that vaguely resembles their physical body in life. They can control these shapes as they controlled their physical bodies.  \n**Traceless Movement.** Sand silhouettes glide through the sand without leaving a trace or creating any telltale sign of their approach, which makes it easy for them to surprise even cautious travelers with their sudden attacks from below.  \n**Undead Nature.** A sand silhouette doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Sand Spider: _When a sand spider attacks, its two speckled, tan legs erupt from the sand, plunging forward with murderous speed, followed by a spider the size of a horse. They attack as often in broad daylight as at night._  \n**Drag Prey into Tunnels.** Sand spiders lurk beneath the arid plains and dry grasslands. These carnivores hunt desert dwellers and plains travelers by burrowing into loose sand so they are completely hidden from view. When prey walks over their trap, the spider lunges up from hiding, snares the prey, and drags it down beneath the sand, where it can wrap the prey in webbing before quickly stabbing it to death.  \n**Spider Packs.** More terrifying than a lone sand spider is a group of sand spiders hunting together. They build connected lair networks called clusters, containing one female and 2 or 3 males. They work together with one sand spider attacking to draw attention, and 2 or 3 others attacking from trapdoors in the opposite direction, behind the skirmish line.",
    "Sanddrift Drake: The serpentine body of the sanddrift drake blends in with the desert sands, its six legs giving it purchase on the canyon walls as it bursts from the ground to snatch its prey._  \nFound in the hottest deserts, the sanddrift drake is a cunning hunter that blends in with the burning sands.  \n**Burrowing Hunter.** The sanddrift drake hunts by hiding beneath the desert sand and ambushing its prey from below. A series of transparent lids protect the drake\u2019s eyes from the harsh light of the desert and the sand where it hides, leaving it with a clear view of approaching prey.  \n**Paralytic Poison.** The drake\u2019s bite holds a paralytic poison, which it uses to separate its prey from a group or herd.",
    "Sandman: _Stick-thin and moon-faced with a raptor\u2019s eyes and a mane of hawk feathers, this grinning humanoid pirouettes as nimbly as a dancer. Between its long, taloned fingers trickles sand that gleams with the cold light of stars._  \n**Bringers of Nightmares.** Sandmen are sinister-looking bringers of sleep and dreams. Visiting the mortal world each night, sandmen ensure that their targets slumber deeply and experience vivid dreams that swell the dream realm\u2019s power. Some sandmen develop a talent for a specific flavor of dream; fantasies of lost love or childhood, prophecies and religious visions, or terrible nightmares.  \n**Abduct Dreamers.** Powerful dreamers attract both the attention and the protection of sandmen: children, madmen, would-be tyrants, and heroes. They protect such charges fiercely but have also been known to abduct them, taking them on wild adventures to inspire yet greater dreams. To them, all dreams are vital and good, be they uplifting or terrifying. Although they bring horrific nightmares as well as idyllic dreams, sandmen are not specifically baneful. Their actions are motivated by their connection to the dream realm, not by concerns over good and evil.  \n**Ethereal Dreamscapes.** When not on the Material Plane, sandmen ride bubble-like dreamscapes through the Ethereal Plane, breaching the Sea of Possibilities, nurturing and harvesting its contents. Sandmen are a common and welcome sight in markets across the Fey Realms, elemental planes, and even in Hell\u2014anywhere that dreams or nightmares are a valuable commodity. They are merciless to any who threaten the sanctity of dreams, but especially dream eaters.",
    "Sandwyrm: _While they mimic the bleached bones of a desert creature, the bony adornments atop along their backs are part of their peculiar melding of bone and scale._  \n**Hidden by Sand.** These lethargic, horned, yellow-scaled lizards spend most of their lives underground, lying in wait under the desert sand with their long-necked, spine-tailed bulk hidden below the surface and only the long, jagged bones lining their backs exposed. These bones resemble a sun-bleached ribcage so perfectly that it attracts carrion birds\u2014and curious travelers. When prey passes between the \u201cribs,\u201d the sandwyrm snaps the rows of bone tightly over its prey. Once its victim is restrained, the sandwyrm paralyzes its meal with repeated stings before carrying it away.  \n**Torpid and Slow.** Sandwyrms sometimes wait for weeks in torpid hibernation before footsteps on the sand alert it to a fresh meal approaching. To guard against lean weeks, sandwyrms store excess prey in subterranean lairs. They\u2019re not above eating carrion if fresh meat isn\u2019t available. When outmatched in a fight, sandwyrms retreat to their lairs with their paralyzed prety.  \n**Peculiar Drakes.** Sandwyrms evolved as an offshoot to drakes or wyverns rather than from true dragons; their anatomy suggests they were originally four-limbed creatures and that their forearms are recent additions to the animal\u2019s body. The bones on their backs may have once been wings, so that sandwyrms are the remnants of some primordial, winged reptiles that migrated to the deep deserts.",
    "Sap Demon: _When a sap demon leaves a tree, its milky amber fluid oozes from an axe wound on a stout maple\u2019s trunk and shapes itself into a small, vaguely humanoid form on the forest floor beside the tree. This languid creature half walks and half flows forward, implacably following the axe wielder\u2019s path to certain revenge._  \n**Tree Oozes.** Sap demons aren\u2019t true demons, but rather are intelligent oozes that form when an enchanted tree is cut or injured. Though typically Small, the larger the sap source is, the larger the resulting creature can be. Over a few hours, they pool into a shape that vaguely resembles their tree\u2019s attacker: for instance, if the tree cutter wore a hat, then a hat may be incorporated into the sap demon\u2019s overall shape. The similarity is faint at best; no one would ever confuse a sap demon for the creature it hunts, because its shape has no sharp features or color other than amber.  \n**Called to Vengeance.** Sap demons can pummel their prey with partially-crystallized fists, but they especially enjoy claiming the weapon that wounded their tree and wielding it to deliver a final blow. Once their prey is destroyed, most sap demons return to their tree, but not all do. Some are curious or malevolent enough to explore the world further.  \n**Reckless Possessors.** A sap demon can possess another creature by grappling it and oozing down its throat. Once inside, the sap demon dominates its host and makes it bleed as the tree bled. Since the sap demon takes no damage when its host is wounded, it\u2019s free to be as reckless as it likes. It might wander into a town to cause trouble. However, no matter how its new body is bandaged or cured, it never stops bleeding slowly. If the host body is killed, the sap demon oozes out during the next hour and either returns to its tree or seeks another host.",
    "Sapphire Jelly: Wisps of frosty air rise from the amorphous, quivering blue puddle. Bits of ice cling to the edges, and the surface has an almost crystalline appearance._  \n**Mountainous Regions.** Sapphire jellies are at home in glacial and mountainous regions among rocks and ice. They are just as likely to be found aboveground as below, but they avoid regions that are warm or dry. They tend to avoid large settlements of warm-blooded creatures, as such creatures consider them an active threat and often seek to destroy them. They prefer the company of creatures not bothered by the cold.  \n**Unnaturally Cold.** Sapphire jellies are extremely cold, freezing water and objects they encounter on contact. Creatures that are caught within them or hit with their attacks are immediately chilled to the bone, and those who are killed by them are permanently transformed into undead. Sapphire jellies can often be found in areas with Open Game License",
    "Sarcophagus Slime: _The sarcophagus opens to reveal an eerie, scintillating light. Wisps of gelid amber ectoplasm undulate outward from a quivering mass with a blackened skull at its center._  \n**Vigilant Slime.** Sarcophagus slimes are amorphous undead guardians placed in the tombs of the powerful to guard them and to wreak terrible vengeance on would-be defilers of the ancient crypts. They seethe with baleful energy, and their blackened skulls retain a simple watchfulness.  \n**Muddled Origins.** Many sages speculate that the first sarcophagus slime was spawned accidentally, in a mummy creation ritual that gave life to the congealed contents of canopic jars rather than the intended, mummified body. Others maintain sarcophagus slime was created by a powerful necromancer-pharaoh bent on formulating the perfect alchemical sentry to guard his crypt.  \n**Death to Tomb Robbers.** These ectoplasmic slimes are the bane of burglars and a constant danger for excavators and antiquarians exploring ruins or tombs. The rituals for their creation have not been entirely lost; modern necromancers still create these undead abominations for their own fell purposes, and tomb robbers are turned into slimes if they lack proper caution.  \n**Undead Nature.** A sarcophagus slime doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Sarsaok: This huge, six-horned, bull-like creature possesses a mane of writhing flames and shimmering metal skin._  \n**Creation of the Gods.** All sarsaok descend from a mighty celestial ox said to have been present at the creation of humanity. Scholars speculate the union of domestic or wild oxen produced the first sarsaok.  \n**Inhospitable Habitats.** The sarsaok dwell in areas of great heat and fire such as Volcanoes or other geologically active regions. In addition to consuming flora, they are known to drink liquid magma and graze on obsidian, pumice, or other volcanic rock.  \n**Peaceful Horror.** Though of great size and strength, sarsaoks are peaceful herbivores similar in demeanor to wild oxen. When threatened, an entire herd attacks until the threat has ended.",
    "Sasori Fukurowashi: A golden pair of glowing, avian irises reveal a large creature on a nearby tree. Horn-like feathered ears sit atop its muscular, winged form. As it shifts on its branch, its wings divulge a hint of insectoid claws beneath them. A soft, echoing voice asks, \u201cAre you lost? Do you need aid?\u201d_  \nSasori fukur\u014dwashi are kami originating from reincarnated noble souls who consistently honored and protected nature in their past life.  \n**Friendly Protectors.** Unlike others of their kind, these kami are not found near specific shrines, and they can\u2019t be summoned. The sasori fukur\u014dwashi are divine spirits inherently connected to all of nature, fulfilling the role of divine agent, messenger, or roaming protector. They are generally peaceable, befriending non-evil humanoids, fey, and other magical beings that don\u2019t defile natural environments.  \n**Nocturnal.** They are inclined to rest or meditate by day and are active from dusk until dawn. Blessed with the ability to shift to and from the Ethereal Plane, these kami have a distinct tactical advantage to aid any nearby kami or respectful and contrite travelers along their way.  \n**Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesn\u2019t require food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Sasquatch: A tall, ape-like creature walks upright, its arms ending in heavy fists. The creature\u2019s lips curl back, revealing long, pointed teeth set in a powerful jaw._  \nSasquatches are large beasts that stalk deep forests and other densely wooded areas. They are bipedal primates that stand about nine feet tall and are covered in black, brown, or red fur.  \n**Famously Elusive.** Many people claim to have seen a sasquatch, but almost none have proof of their interaction with the beast, creating questions about the creature\u2019s existence. Skeptics claim sasquatch sightings are simply misidentified bears, apes, or similar creatures. Many sages and hunters journey deep into forests, hoping to find proof sasquatches exist and returning only with a handful of fur that could belong to almost any animal. In truth sasquatches are solitary nocturnal creatures that generally avoid confrontation. They prefer to stay in the shadows of the forest, dining on vegetation and insects while staying clear of other creatures.  \n**Hidden Lairs.** Sasquatches are smart enough to hide the entrances to their lairs with heavy boulders, underbrush, fallen trees, a waterfall, or some other obstruction that appears to be a natural part of the terrain. They hide gathered food and shiny trinkets they find in the forest in these cozy homes, where they rest during daylight hours.  \n**Aggressive When Provoked.** Though sasquatches prefer to avoid confrontation, they fight savagely when cornered or if another creature threatens their home or food source. Their powerful fists and teeth make formidable weapons. Sasquatches do not hesitate to initiate a conflict when threatened.  \n**Attracted and Soothed by Music.** There are some who claim sasquatches are drawn and calmed by music, particularly songs with a lullaby-like quality. These tales come with a warning: stopping the song before the sasquatch is lulled to sleep by its melody causes the beast to go into a violent rage.",
    "Sathaq Worm: _This titanic worm\u2019s rocky hide is rough and hard as stone. Its yawning gullet writhes with miniature worms like itself._  \n**Elemental Predators.** Sathaq worms are nightmarish predators from the Plane of Elemental Earth, 30 feet long and 10 feet thick, with rugged brown hide embedded with stones. They devour stone and flesh with equal ease.  \n**Guts Filled with Larvae.** Sathaq worms are solitary; they approach each other only to mate. Their young incubate inside the worms\u2019 gullets. Creatures they swallow are simultaneously digested by the parent worm and devoured by the larvae.  \n**Painful Presence.** Ultrasonic noise and magical ripples that tear at flesh and bone make the very presence of a sathaq worm extremely uncomfortable for creatures of the Material Plane.",
    "Savager: _A porcupine-quilled creature built like a grizzly bear with claws and fangs like scimitars. A savager\u2019s forelegs are mangled and scabbed, and its eyes shine with hatred and anticipation._  \n**Driven by Dark Spirits.** While druids claim these bear-like animals are not cursed or enchanted, the savager\u2019s habit of killing any living creature on sight is not natural behavior. Hunger doesn\u2019t explain their attacks, since savagers eat only part of their kills before abandoning the meal and looking for other animals to attack. Some dark forest spirit drives them.  \n**Gnaws Itself.** When there are no other creatures nearby to attack, a savager gnaws on its own forelimbs, resulting in scabs, scars, and calluses so thick and numb that they protect the savager from even the sharpest of swords.  \n**Rare Meetings.** The only creature a savager won\u2019t attack on sight is another savager. If they are of the same sex, the two avoid each out of self-preservation, and if they\u2019re of the opposite sex, they mate so ferociously that both creatures are left wounded, angry, and hungry. A savager litter contains anywhere from 10 to 25 cubs, all of them born able to walk and fend for themselves. This is important, because within 24 hours after giving birth, a savager mother no longer recognizes her own offspring, and she will attack and cannibalize any that don\u2019t escape on their own.  \nA savager weighs 1,800 pounds and is 11 feet long.",
    "Scarlet Ibis: This gigantic marsh bird has blood-red feathers and a scythe-like beak. Its eyes shine with intelligence as it scans its surroundings._  \n**Accursed Bird.** Scarlet ibises are not inherently malevolent, and many visitors to the swamp assume they are natural, if overly large, birds. However, their beaks bestow unluck on those touched or struck by them. The ibises usually reserve their cursed attacks as retribution for themselves, but swamp dwellers sometimes plea for the birds\u2019 intercession on those who have wronged them. Scarlet ibises have keen judgment to determine the worthiness of these requests. Those who know about scarlet ibises and their terrible curses avoid killing the birds and typically warn others about the consequences of killing them. Less scrupulous folk instead encourage na\u00efve travelers to destroy a scarlet ibis then pick off the travelers suffering from the aftereffects of combat with the birds.  \n**Dream Portent.** The scarlet ibis is a symbol of ill omens that appears in dreams. This omen precedes a setback\u2014such as inclement weather, a tremor, the group getting lost, or a lame mount or pack animal\u2014but it can also indicate a doomed mission. After a series of unfortunate incidents, the scarlet ibis makes a physical appearance, signifying the bad luck has ended. This sometimes incites the unfortunates to avenge themselves on the bird under the mistaken belief the ibis is the cause of the problems.  \n**Egret Harpy Friends.** Scarlet ibises congregate with Open Game License",
    "Scheznyki: _These small, vicious fey look like dirty, lazy dwarves dressed in burlap pants and shirts tied on with dirty twine and frayed rope. They are usually bootless with broken, dirty toenails and wearing rough burlap and leather tams as hats._  \n**Corrupted Dwarves.** Nicknamed \u201cvanishers,\u201d these small, vicious, dwarf-like fey haunt abandoned quarries and ancient ruins, killing and robbing unsuspecting visitors. Legend says the scheznykis are lazy dwarves corrupted by the shadow fey, though others claim that these are dwarves who swore allegiance to fey lords and ladies long ago. They live in drowned and abandoned mines, tumbledown ruins, and even in the tomb complexes of long\u2011departed priests and god-kings.  \n**Magical Hats.** Their shadow fey masters have given them magical hats that allow them to fly and become invisible at will. These hats can be stolen and used by adventurers, but the scheznykis fight hard to retrieve them.  \n**Arcane Beards.** If an adventurer can successfully grapple a scheznyki, they can attempt to cut the creature\u2019s beard with a magical blade (the beard is AC 15 and has 5 hp). When an attacker successfully cuts off the beard, the scheznyki loses access to all spell-like and spell casting abilities\u2014and the beard hair itself is valuable in making potion inks.  \nIf the scheznyki loses its hat and beard at the same time, it falls into a deep, wasting coma and dies in 24 hours or when next exposed to sunlight. When this occurs, the scheznyki\u2019s body crumbles into dust and blows away one round later. If its beard is magically mended or regrown, or its hat restored to its head before this happens, the scheznyki recovers fully and immediately.",

    "Scribe Devil: A fiend with yellow skin covered in Infernal script examines a scroll as its pointed, ink-drenched tail twitches, eager to make corrections._  \nScribe devils are the ill-tempered authors of infernal contracts, which outline deals between mortals and devils.  \n**Masters of Legal Logic.** No fiends better understand the power of bureaucracy and a written contract than scribe devils. Able to draw up a contract for a deal at a moment\u2019s notice, these devils carefully select every letter of a written deal. Typically, their ink-soaked tails craft documents that confuse and misdirect mortals into raw deals. If a fellow fiend gets on a scribe devil\u2019s bad side or in the way, the scribe devil has no qualms about writing a bad contract for the fiend.  \n**Contract Makers.** Scribe devils make their documents from the skins of damned mortals acquired with the fiend\u2019s knife-like claws. Their ink is the blood of Open Game License",
    "Scrofin: This upright, muscular boar has short, brown fur. Though it stands on cloven hooves, its arms end in oversized fists._  \n**Seeker of Champions.** The scrofin is a powerfully built creature that seeks to find a worthy challenger for a wrestling challenge. A winner is declared when one creature holds its opponent in a grapple for 30 seconds. The scrofin is aware its natural gifts make it a formidable foe and feels duty-bound to make others aware of its advantages. An honorable battle is its highest goal, and it ensures that no great harm comes to its opponent during the contest, immediately relenting if its opponent submits.  \n**Short Tempered.** If the scrofin feels its opponent is fighting dishonorably or if something unrelated to the wrestling match harms it (a cast spell, a hidden weapon, or similar), it goes berserk at the betrayal. In normal combat situations, it loses its temper when it takes too many injuries. The scrofin can calm itself but only chooses to when it believes its opponents are truly contrite about breaking its trust or harming it.  \n**Outcast from the Courts.** The scrofins\u2019 sense of honor is at odds with many of their fellow fey, regardless of court, who believe exploiting any advantage in a situation is acceptable. This coupled with what the fey see as the scrofins\u2019 tiresome insistence on proving their physical superiority makes them unwelcome in many fey courts. For their part, scrofins are content to walk the mortal world in search of champions.",
    "Scroll Mummy: Parchment inscribed with arcane writing completely covers this creature, leaving room only for its glowing, purple eyes._  \nA scroll mummy expedites its passage into undeath through an arcane ritual that consumes several scrolls, while incorporating the surviving scrolls into the creature\u2019s body, similarly to burial wrappings for an ordinary mummy.  \n**Curseless.** This alternate Open Game License",
    "Sea Dragon Wyrmling: _This aquamarine dragon has a shark\u2019s head that tapers off into a sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings._  \n**Divine Dragons.** Sea dragons are the children of the ocean, and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.  \nDespite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.  \n**Shipwreck Art.** Sea dragons love collecting treasure, especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon\u2019s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.  \n**Sunken Memorials.** A sea dragon\u2019s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.  \n\n## Sea Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nSea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.  \nWhatever the place, it\u2019s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.  \nThe sky surrounding a sea dragon\u2019s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall\u2019s space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary sea dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.\n* Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water.\n* Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, conditions of the sea surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.",
    "Selang: _This grinning humanoid looks like a handsome man, though his skin is black as obsidian, his eye glow red, and he has both insectoid legs and antennae._  \n**Dark Satyrs.** The selang or dark satyrs are twisted and vicious fauns who have abandoned nature worship, and instead venerate ancient gods of deep and malign intelligence. Selangs seek to help those evil gods enter the mortal world by opening dark portals and bridging a path to realms beyond mortal understanding.  \n**Battle Song and Laughter.** Selangs relish battle, pain, and torture\u2014they find violence thrilling and bloodshed exciting, and they often laugh, sing, and boast shamelessly during combat. Although they are the diplomats and spokesmen of the old gods, their manic speech and alien logic can be hard to follow, requiring an Intelligence check (DC 16) to understand a dark satyr each round. They are most comfortable with the slithering tones of the Void Speech.  \n**Blasphemous Music.** Their cults and settlements are often found at the sites sacred to the dark gods, making hypnotic and alien harmonies with swarms of dorreqi. They are rarely the strongest soldiers, instead encouraging evil humanoids or other creatures of martial mien to fill the ranks, while the dark satyrs use their magic and poison against their foes.",
    "Serpopard: _These spotted and scaly quadrupeds run on hairless leonine paws, while their cat heads perch atop sinuous, serpentine necks._  \n**Swaying, Snakelike Cats.** Serpopards are 13 feet long and weigh 600 lb, with little gender dimorphism. They have feline bodies but long, serpentine necks topped by vaguely draconic heads. Their hairless paws have wickedly curved, retractable talons. A serpopard\u2019s neck is in constant motion, swaying like a cobra, allowing it to track foes on all sides and to strike in unexpected directions.  \n**Easily Distracted.** Serpopards are foul-tempered predators and scavengers, and are known to occasionally resort to cannibalizing their weakest pack mate. They actively hunt humanoids when possible and also attack other predators to steal their kills\u2014or to kill and eat the predators, then take their kills. Serpopards are not tenacious hunters, however. They can be distracted from a pursuit by the appearance of an easier meal.  \n**Musk Glands.** In some culture, serpopard pelts and musk glands are prized for use in fashion and perfumes. Images of these odd animals appear regularly in southern tomb iconography and temple decoration.",
    "Servant of the Unsated God: The grinning ghoul\u2019s mace drips with shadow as it chants prayers to its dark god. Another shadowy grin appears on top of the ghoul\u2019s and extends out, consuming all it touches._  \n**Worshiper of Hunger.** The Unsated God, is a god of death, hunger, and the undead. The bulk of his followers, especially in the deep caverns of the world, are undead. The most common of these followers are darakhul\u2014 intelligent and civilized ghouls\u2014who share their lord\u2019s unholy hunger. The servants of the Unsated God act as civil officials, support the imperial army, and spread the faith (often by slaying intruding surface dwellers then recruiting them as newly risen undead).  \n**Hungry Dead Nature.** The ghoul requires no air or sleep.",
    "Shabti: _Wearing silver and red enamel pectoral jewelry and stylized armlets, as well as carrying a thin, carved stick, this angular, dark\u2011eyed human appears almost normal. When it moves, gears clash and whir faintly within it._  \n**Lifelike Servants.** Shabti are constructs made to tend to their masters needs in the afterlife. Dressed in ceremonial regalia, they are sometimes mistaken for living beings by intruders into their ancient tombs, though careful examination reveals faintly glowing hieroglyphs graven into their garments and their bodies.  \n**Insane Machines.** Usually driven mad by centuries within its master\u2019s tomb, a shabti fiercely attacks anything that threatens its sworn charge. Some ceaselessly babble ancient scriptures or invocations to the gods of death.  \n**Ancient Weapons.** A shabti fights by releasing its serpentine armlets, then using telekinesis against spellcasters while thrashing anyone within reach with archaic but effective stick\u2011fighting maneuvers. The shabti\u2019s weapon, the nabboot, is a 4-foot stick made of rattan or bundled reeds; this weapon was common in ancient forms of single-stick fighting. Shabti always fight until destroyed.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A shabti slime doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Shadhavar: _Often a shadhavar is first noticed for the haunting melody it makes, and some mistake them for unicorns or fey steeds. On closer inspection, they look like desiccated unicorns, their skeletons clearly visible beneath their taut flesh._  \n**Shadow Horses.** Shadhavar are natives of the plane of Shadow. Although they resemble undead unicorns, they are living creatures imbued with shadow essences.  \n**Fey and Undead Riders.** While the shadhavar are intelligent creatures, they sometimes serve as mounts for the shadow fey, noctiny, hobgoblins, wights, or other creatures. They expect to be treated well during such an arrangement; more than one unkind rider has ridden off on a shadhavar and never returned.  \n**Deceptive Hunters.** Shadhavar use their hollow horn to play captivating sounds for defense or to draw in prey. They hunt when they must and are not discriminating about their quarry, but shadhavar primarily eat carrion. Despite their horrific appearance, they are not naturally evil.",
    "Shadow Beast: _A mass of shadows and cloudstuff, never touching the ground, a shadow beast may at first look harmless\u2014except for its clawed hands and the glint of its jagged teeth._  \n**Called from the Void.** Shadow beasts are thought to be the result of shadow fey dabbling in the magic of the void. Almost shapeless and largely incorporeal, through an act of will they can form rough semblances of their old bodies when needed.  \n**Hate the Past.** The motivations of these creatures are inscrutable. They despise light and anything that reminds them of light or of their former existence. Beyond that, little is understood about them.  \n**Cryptic Messages.** Shadow beasts are seldom found in groups, but when they are, they seem to have no difficulty or reluctance about operating and fighting together. They have been known to deliver cryptic and threatening messages, but speaking is difficult for them. At times, they perform arcane rituals with the aid of evil humanoids and the use of dark materials. In these rituals they sacrifice magical energies and life blood as well as the tears of innocents and the souls of the damned.",
    "Shadow Boxer: The shadow caught the man\u2019s eye. It looked and moved like a house cat, but there was no animal present to cast it. He followed the shadow as it moved along the wall then transferred to the ground, not noticing the distortion of light behind him. The last thing he heard as the invisible feline tore out his throat was a contented purr._  \n**Finicky Spirits.** Shadow boxers are the physical manifestation of feline collective memory. They are found in urban areas and other places people congregate. Like other fey, they desire to be placated by mortals, and they allow their presence to be detected to induce people to leave them gifts. A shadow boxer develops relationships with one household at a time and protects it. Households that don\u2019t leave sufficient tribute or that cease offering it gifts entirely swiftly find their members targeted by the slighted fey.  \n**Council of Cats.** When they sleep, shadow boxers share dreams with all mundane cats and other shadow boxers within a mile. Within the dream, the cats and the shadow boxer gambol and roughhouse while they share information. Many capers and activities are planned during these dream sessions, and seeing a large clowder of cats getting along is a sign that a shadow boxer in the area has a game afoot. Shadow boxers despise creatures, such as Open Game License",
    "Shadow Fey: _\u201cKind words open even iron doors.\u201d_ \n _\u2014Twilight, a courtier to the shadow fey_  \nTo most, the shadow fey are little more than a dancing shadow among the leaves. To savants, they are the creatures that taught the shadowdancers all they know, and kept many secrets to themselves. They were once elves like all others, dwelling in mortal lands beneath the sun. An ancient catastrophe drove them to darkness, and now they are creatures of the shadow. Though they can be found on the Material Plane, they are inextricably tied to the plane of Shadows, and that is the seat of their power and culture.  \nShadow fey superficially resemble other elves, but they\u2019re rarely mistaken for their lighted cousins. Skin tones among the shadow fey range from alabaster white to ebony black, with varying shades of gray in between, but they are otherwise lacking in color. A few have a scintillating shimmer to their skin. Many shadow fey grow horns that sweep out from their hair, varying in size from subtle nubs to obvious spikes. Others have shocking sets of teeth.  \n**Dual Natured.** The shadow fey are contradictory beings. They boast some of the best features of elves, tempered by aspects of a fouler nature. They can be deliberate and purposeful, but they\u2019re also given to perplexing whimsy. Mortal creatures trying to fathom shadow fey motivations are in for a maddening experience; they are often illogical, capricious, and seemingly thrive on annoying others.  \n**Split Rulership.** The Summer Court and Winter Court each rule the shadow fey in the appropriate season. The turning of these seasons follows no clear calendar or schedule, though it is skewed toward summer.  \nOther fey call them the Sc\u00e1thsidhe (pronounced scAH-shee), or shadow faeries, and they are usually counted among the unseelie, though they would dispute that characterization. They simply call themselves part of the sidhe, and consider themselves an extension of the Seelie Court.  \n**The Reach of Darkness.** Their bond with darkness allows the shadow fey to slip through distant spaces, traversing darkness itself from one place to another. Not only can every shadow fey slip from a shadow or patch of darkness to instantly appear elsewhere, they also control the mysterious and powerful shadow roads. Shadow roads are magical pathways that connect points on the Material Plane by dipping through the plane of shadow, allowing rapid and completely secret travel for the fey\u2014and more importantly, for their weapons of war, their trade goods, and their allies.  \nThe shadow fey all have an instinctive understanding of how a shadow road functions, and they are adept at both operating the entrance portals and navigating any hazards on the road. This bond with darkness has a price, of course, and the shadow fey shun the sun\u2019s light.",
    "Shadow Giant: If not for the horns curling from its brow and the long, bestial talons erupting from its fingers, the creature would look like a grim-faced, ashen-skinned elf of monstrous height._  \n**Cast into Darkness.** In ages past, shadow giants were called hjartakinde, and they dwelt in the lands of the fey. When the giants declined to go to war with the shadow fey, the fey exiled them to the Shadow  \n**Realm.** When they refused to serve the dark fey courts, the queen cursed them into their current form.  \n**Of Two Worlds.** Shadow giants are cursed to exist simultaneously on the Shadow Realm and the Material Plane. Unable to properly live in either world, they have become embittered and indignant. Shadow giants desire to end their cursed existence but lash out against anyone who shows them pity or mercy.  \n**Undying.** When a shadow giant is killed, its spirit roils in the Shadow Realm for a century before it is reborn to its cursed fate.",
    "Shadow of Death: Draped in black funerary garb, ribbons of which move of their own accord, the creature has the appearance of a skeletal angel._  \n**Angels of Death.** Once beings of light and beauty who championed justice across the planes, the shadows of death formed after some agent of entropy discarded their bodies into the Void. Their celestial forms protected them from ultimate annihilation, but their minds were forever darkened by the plane\u2019s dread influence.  \n**Deathly Avatars.** Shadows of death sometimes answer the call of death cults. Rather than aiding the cultists though, the shadows kill the cultists before spreading the grave\u2019s shadow across the world.  \n**Immortal Nature.** The shadow of death doesn\u2019t require food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Sharkjaw Skeleton: _The humanoid form approaches through the murky water, but as it nears, it becomes clear that this is no living thing. It is made entirely of sharks\u2019 jaws, joined together and brought to life with grim magic._  \nMade from numerous, interlocking shark\u2019s jaws, these horrors are animated through foul magic into a large, vaguely humanoid shape. Sahuagin priests animate them to guard their sepulchers of bones. These sharkjaw skeletons lie among great piles of bones, waiting to rise up and attack any uninvited souls who invade the sanctity of sahuagin holy sites. Others guard pirate treasures or ancient shipwrecks.  \n**Undead Automaton.** Being mindless, sharkjaw skeletons do nothing without orders from their creator, and they follow those instructions explicitly. A sharkjaw skeleton\u2019s creator can give it new commands as long as the skeleton is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. Otherwise, a sharkjaw skeleton follows its last instructions to the best of its ability and to the exclusion of all else, though it will always fight back if attacked.  \n**Undead Nature.** A shroud doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Shellycoat: _Despite being short and squat, this creature\u2019s relationship with a troll is undeniable. The kinship is most notable in the long arms and thick, pebbly hide._  \n**Long Handed and Toad-like.** The shellycoat is a warped and spiteful creature also called the Iamh fada, or \u201clong hands,\u201d and they are frequently referred to as bridge trolls. Despite being fey, they are distantly related to true trolls. Unlike those tall, lanky creatures, a shellycoat is dwarfish and toad-like, with short, bent, legs and freakishly long arms with swollen, distended joints. It can further dislocate and stretch these joints to alarming lengths.  \n**Bridges and Pools.** The shellycoat can be found in abandoned wells or behind waterfalls, in deep tide pools, or beneath the ice of frozen ponds, but their preferred haunt has always been under bridges. They are most active during nighttime and on heavily overcast days, because of their mortal dread of sunlight.  \nA shellycoat's favored tactic is to lie in wait under the water or ice (or bridge) and surprise its prey. It strikes outward or upward from its hiding place to snatch children, livestock (preferably goats), and lone travelers or fishermen. Prey is dragged down to the shadows and water to be robbed and devoured.  \n**Shining Garments.** A shellycoat will always have fashioned for itself a coat, cloak, or shirt of colored pebbles, glass, and polished river shells. These adornments are crude but beautiful and sometimes magical.",
    "Shiftshroom: The plain, white mushroom suddenly shifts and twists into a poisonous deathcap._  \nIn their natural form, shiftshrooms are white mushrooms with bifurcated stalks. Their natural ability to disguise themselves as other mushrooms evolved as a defense against creatures harvesting them for food.  \n_**Sought for Food.**_ Roasted shiftshroom has a nutty flavor and aroma and is considered a delicacy by many of the Underworld\u2019s denizens. Discerning surface world gourmands pay respectable sums for shiftshroom caps due to the difficulty in harvesting them from the Underworld and the difficulty in growing them above ground.  \n_**Hidden in View.**_ Shiftshrooms can often be found interspersed with deadlier fungi. The Underworld hides colonies of the fungus wherein only a few of the mushrooms toward the outer edges of the group are dangerous varieties of fungus, and the remainder are disguised shiftshrooms.",
    "Shimmer Seal: This tusked seal is nearly transparent, including its internal organs, except for a few spots dotting its hide._  \n**Unseen Pinnipeds.** Shimmer seals traverse their typical habitats hidden from prey and predators alike. Their translucent skin and internal organs allow them to blend in with water and against icy backgrounds. Against other backgrounds, they leave a telltale shimmer, giving them their name. However, the seals can still take the unwary by surprise in less-than-ideal conditions. The only time the seal fully loses it translucency is when it consumes its diet of fish or small mammals, during which observers receive a breathtaking (or nauseating) view of the seals\u2019 digestive process. The seals are aware of this vulnerability and usually feast in hidden locations. Arctic druids and rangers who successfully befriend shimmer seals use them as spies or as an advance wave of attack.  \n**Guardian of Seals.** Though shimmer seals notionally look like harbor seals, they are found among many different species of seal. Scholars who have studied the strange seals concluded shimmer seals are created when the spirits of creatures passionate about protecting overhunted animals merge with those of ordinary seals. When a shimmer seal dies protecting a pod of seals from hunters, one of the seals transforms into a new shimmer seal within a minute of the other shimmer seal\u2019s death, reinforcing this theory. While shimmer seals are vigilant against hunting by humanoids, they allow natural predators to cull the seals under their protection, understanding the natural order and its importance.  \n**Rallying Seal.** A shimmer seal allows other seals to see it, and it can allow allied creatures to locate it. The presence of a shimmer seal emboldens the seals under its protection, transforming a pod of seals that might scatter in the face of armed opposition into an army of teeth and flippers, with the shimmer seal leading the counterattack. No one knows if the shimmer seal is aware of its ability to reincarnate shortly after it dies, but its fearlessness points to it possessing a certainty of survival.",
    "Shoggoth: _A shoggoth is an intelligent, gelatinous blob that can reshape itself at will. Created by an elder race as servants, the shoggoths rebelled long ago and slew their masters without pity. Since that time, they\u2019ve lived in isolated or desolate regions, devouring whatever they encounter and absorbing its flesh into their own amorphous, shifting forms._  \n**Constant Growth.** When in a spherical form, a shoggoth\u2019s mass is enough to have a 10- to 15-foot diameter, though this is just an average size. Shoggoths continue growing throughout their lives, though the eldest among them grow very slowly indeed, and some shoggoths may shrink from starvation if they deplete a territory of resources.  \n**Mutable Form.** A shoggoth can form eyes, mouths, tentacles, and other appendages as needed, though it lacks the control to truly polymorph into another creature\u2019s shape and hold it.",
    "Shriekbat: This midnight-blue bat has a cavern-filling wingspan. The air near its mouth, large enough to carry a horse, visibly vibrates with sound pulses._  \nShriekbats thrive in the cavernous spaces of the Underworld where they face little competition from dragons, rocs, and other large flying creatures, as they would aboveground. Despite their enormousness, the bats deftly maneuver among the stalactites and stalagmites crowding underground caverns. When they attack prey, or in the very rare cases where they must escape predators, they emit a terrible shriek that overwhelms their foes and allows them to easily grab prey or escape. Shriekbat echolocation uses subsonic frequencies, allowing the bats to fly in relative silence.  \n**Kobold Companions.** Kobold bat keepers know the secret to raising young shriekbats. The bat keepers often risk their lives to procure young, using the bats for protection and as companions. A bat keeper returns its shriekbat to the wild before the bat reaches adulthood, when it would become too large for the cramped kobold tunnels. A bat keeper tracks the shriekbats it releases, and often returns to visit its former companions. Shriekbats prove surprisingly keen at remembering former kobold handlers (whether such handlers treated them well or poorly), and they often allow fondly remembered handlers to take a single pup from their litters, ensuring the pup survives to adulthood and renewing the cycle.  \n**Long-Lived Omnivores.** Shriekbats live for nearly 50 years. They are social and promiscuous creatures that live in small groups in large caverns. They are omnivorous but prefer fresh meat to other food with lizards taking up the majority of their diet. Shriekbats can survive on rotten flesh, which allows them to eat ghouls and other undead populating the Underworld, but they find it less palatable. In overcrowded situations where multiple groups of shriekbats roost in the same cavern, a group of shriekbats might break away to find another hunting location if food becomes scarce.",
    "Shroud: _Shrouds appear much like they did in life, only translucent and immaterial. Their voices are weak._  \n**Bitter Spirits.** Shrouds are transitional creatures: remnants of wicked people who died but refuse to rest in peace, yet have not grown strong enough to become shadows. They are aggressive enemies of all living creatures and the light that nurtures life. Shrouds blend naturally into darkness, but they stand out starkly in bright light.  \n**Thin Outlines.** Shrouds look like flickering shadowy outlines of the people they were before they died, retaining the same height and body type.  \n**Repetitive Speech.** Shrouds cannot converse, but they occasionally can be heard cruelly whispering a name, term, or phrase over and over again: something that must have had meaning to them in life.  \n**Undead Nature.** A shroud doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Shukankor: This creature has gaudy green and purple feathers, stunted humanoid limbs, a cruel, vulture-like beak, and multiple eyes that swivel about on long, lime-colored stalks. It hoots diabolically as it approaches._  \n**Wasteland Hunters.** Desolate badlands, deserts, and wastelands warped by foul sorcery are the prime feeding grounds for these colorful aberrations, who use their vicious claws and beaks to kill and devour any creature they encounter. Due to their enormous size, they sometimes resort to eating rotting and undead flesh, and they can even eat rocks, plants, and dirt in a pinch. Because they are intelligent monsters, shukankors can be parlayed with, though their demands are usually extravagant and vile.  \n**Strength in Numbers.** The shukankor\u2019s ability to temporarily replicate itself aids it greatly in battle, especially when it is outnumbered or facing a particularly powerful opponent. These replicas are smaller, weaker clones of the shukankor that obey its telepathic commands and even sacrifice themselves to protect their creator. Shukankors are neither female nor male and reproduce by allowing their replicas to remain alive. After a day, these replicas become free-thinking and separate from the parent shukankor. A month later, they grow into full-sized shukankors with all the powers of their progenitor.",
    "Shurale: At first glance this creature resembles a satyr, its lower body covered in brown fur with goat-like hooves, yet the twisted horn sprouting from its forehead and the wide, manic grin on its comical face proves it is something far more dangerous._  \n**Devilish Fey.** While many fey are evil and twisted creatures, few are worse than the dreaded shurale, a deadly satyr-like monster that causes horrible hilarity with its ticklish touch. It inflicts a victim with a deadly bout of laughter that causes its internal organs to rupture and fail. After the victim dies, the shurale cuts it into pieces, leaving the remains for the scavengers.  \n**Feeds on Laughter.** A shurale feeds on the sobbing laughs of its victims as they expire, its own health mysteriously revitalized in the process. Because of this, shurale lairs are typically located within a few miles of a humanoid settlement, where it can easily lure lone inhabitants into the woods. While most of their prey are humanoids living in alpine or heavily forested regions, shurales are not picky and have been known to attack orcs, ogres, trolls, and even hill giants.  \n**Woodcutter\u2019s Curse.** Many believe that a shurale is the spirit of a woodcutter who died a lonely and embittered death after being ridiculed by family. While such an occurrence would be exceedingly rare and most sages scoff at such suggestions, the shurale\u2019s skill with the woodcutter\u2019s axe and its strange behavior cannot be denied.",
    "Silenal: The halfling takes a long drink from a mug, its wild, graying hair falling back to reveal the creature\u2019s pointed nose and sharp chin. Its bloodshot eyes hold a glimmer of mischief as it sets down the mug._  \n**Tavern Spirits.** Sileni adopt a specific tavern or inn as their own. The presence of a silenal is usually discovered slowly by the owner. Perhaps they notice the bar towels have all been mended or that the empty bottles have been placed outside the back door. If the owner accepts this assistance and leaves small gifts of food and drink, the silenal becomes more active. After hours, the silenal spends its time ensuring the establishment is cleaned to a shine and ready for the next day\u2019s business. If the owner and the silenal are at odds, however, the small mischiefs and mishaps caused by the silenal quickly drive the owner out of business.  \n**Flawed Advisors.** While the business is open, a silenal spends most of its time drinking and conversing with the patrons. Sileni are curious about mortals and find their tales and troubles fascinating. If a creature conversing with a silenal asks it for advice, the counsel received is invariably flawed. The silenal, interested in hearing more dramatic tales, offers guidance which is guaranteed to get its conversation partner in hot water in the hopes the recipient will return to lament new, entertaining troubles.  \n**Calm in the Storm.** Regardless of how chaotic activity gets in its bar, the silenal is strangely unaffected. Tavern brawls, whether caused by the silenal or not, never target it. The damage caused by fights is also reduced and rarely results in more than a few broken chairs and tankards.",
    "Skein Witch: _Skein witches are androgynous humanoids mummified in writhing diamond thread. Their skin is translucent, and suspended inside their bodies are dozens of quivering hourglasses in place of organs._  \n**Shepherd Destiny.** Skein witches are curators of destiny and enforcers of what must be. They voyage across the planes, weaving the strands of fate at the behest of their goddess-creator. Although they carry out their charge without regard to petty mortal concerns, they can be persuaded to bend fate for powerful petitioners whose interests align with those of their goddess.  \n**Surrounded by Guardians.** Despite their supernatural abilities, a skein witch\u2019s physical body is frail. Because of that, they tend to surround themselves with undead, constructs, or other brutish, soulless guardians cut free from the thread of fate.  \n**Fear All Cards.** If a deck of many things is brought within 30 feet of a skein witch, she emits a psychic wail and disintegrates.",
    "Skin Bat: _A repulsive, batlike creature darts from the Stygian darkness. Its body consists entirely of rotting sheets of stolen skin. Though its large eyes are glassy and lifeless, an unmistakably evil intent glimmers within them as a toothless mouth spreads wide in hunger._  \nSkin bats are undead creatures created from skin flayed from the victims of sacrificial rites. They are given a measure of unlife by a vile ritual involving immersion in Abyssal flesh vats and invocations to the relevant demon lords. They feed on the skin of living beings to replenish their own constantly rotting skin. Their acidic saliva acts as a paralytic poison and leaves ugly scars on those who survive an attack.  \n**Cliff and Dungeon Dwellers.** Skin bats prey on the unwary but do not develop sinister plots of their own. Their flocks can be encountered in isolated areas accessible only by flight or by climbing treacherous cliffs. Skin bats can exist in any climate. In cool climes, they feed only infrequently, because the cold preserves their forms and reduces the need to replenish decaying flesh. This also explains why they are attracted to the dark depths of ageless dungeons. In wet, tropical climes where their skin decomposes rapidly, skin bats are voracious feeders by necessity.  \n**Accidental Treasures.** Skin bats have no use for magic items or wealth, but occasionally a ring or necklace from a past victim gets embedded in their fleshy folds, where it becomes an unintended trophy.  \nThe typical skin bat has an 8-foot wingspan. The color of their skin matches that of their prey, so a skin bat\u2019s coloration can change over time. A skin bat weighs about 15 lb.  \n**Undead Nature.** A skin bat doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Skitterhaunt: _This large vermin moves erratically, leaking noxious fluid from its cracked exoskeleton._  \n**Ooze Vermin.** This parasitic ooze lives in the shells of monstrous vermin, such as scorpions and spiders, that it has infested and killed. A skitterhaunt creature might be mistaken for its original, living version at a glance, but the sluggish, erratic movements and oozing carapace of skitterhaunts quickly reveal their true nature.  \n**Wide Range of Prey.** A skitterhaunt infection can decimate whole nests of vermin. When those are in short supply, these oozes move on to prey on other species, such as ants, crabs, tosculi, and sometimes even zombies or reptiles.  \n**Hosts Required.** Skitterhaunts can\u2019t survive long outside their host creatures; they quickly liquefy and lose their cohesion. A body abandoned by a skitterhaunt is an eerie, hollowed-out husk with a strong, acidic odor.",
    "Skydancer: Air elemental warden children learn to fly before they learn to walk, accompanying their parents through the snow-fattened clouds on _skysails_ (see pg. 45). While all air wardens love the sensation of flight, few hone their skills as rigorously as the skydancers. These graceful masters of the wind are at once artists, performers, and warriors; they are beloved heroes of their people, both defending them in times of danger and bringing them happiness in times of peace.",
    "Slow Storm: _Wisps of humid wind revolve around this spiny ball. Two massive black eyes and a dark mouth are the only features visible through its static straight quills._  \n**Chaos Aging.** Despite its comical appearance, a slow storm is a creature of chaos, able to visit the pains of old age on the young and fit. It turns the bodies of physically able creatures against them, forcing them to choose between relative inactivity or ever\u2011increasing pain.  \n**Surrounded by Wind.** A slow storm is a smaller creature than the space it occupies, and its vulnerable physical body is protected by a cyclonic wind surrounding it. The slow storm occupies a space 15 feet square, but its physical body occupies just the center 5-foot space. The nucleus of a slow storm is a two-foot radius sphere weighing 75 lb. The rest of the space is \u201coccupied\u201d by protective, high-speed wind. Only the central, physical body is susceptible to damage; the wind is just wind. Enemies using melee weapons with less than 10-foot reach must step into the whirlwind to attack the slow storm.  \n**Static Generator.** A slow storm has no internal organs other than its brain, and it lives on the energy and moisture it drains from opponents. Its quills not only deflect debris but also generate a ball of static electricity that delivers a shock attack.  \n**Elemental Nature.** A slow storm doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Sluagh Swarm: _Some say the sluagh are fey turned by vampires, while others say they are the evil souls of violent men, who cannot rest and return to kill. Still others claim they are the souls of devilbound gnomes who committed suicide. All agree that they are loathsome by nature._  \n**Cowards Alone.** These tiny, malevolent fey dwell in darkness. Alone they are cowards, but they are rarely encountered alone. They are most active during the winter, especially during winter\u2019s long nights. They usually speak to their victims as they attack, but those shouts are little more than whispers to the ears of their prey.  \n**Chilling Touch.** Sluagh feed by using their chilling touch. They devour small animals if nothing more appetizing is available. Their victims are easy to identify; their skin is unnaturally cold, and their features are frozen in fear.  \nSwarms of sluagh serve hags, devils, trollkin, and evil fey who know the blood rituals to summon and direct them. Shadow fey and drow send them against other elves, often targeting the defenders of elven settlements, or their spouses and children.  \n**Legless Flocks.** Sluagh are tiny, gaunt humanoid creatures the size of a weasel. They have no legs; instead their torso tapers off in a disquieting way. Though they can fly, they can also pull themselves quickly across the ground with their arms. They are always draped in black, though their actual skin and hair are pale white. They have sharp claws and fangs, and their eyes are entirely black. In masses, they somewhat resemble a flock of strange birds.",
    "Smaragdine Golem: _This large statue of emerald-green crystal has a humanoid body with the head of an ibis. Tiny symbols and runes are etched into it, and portions are inlaid with bits of gold._  \n**Occult Initiates.** Smaragdine golems are crafted by disciples of occult esoterica to guard their secret meeting halls, sacred texts, and the arcane books of power.  \n**Emerald Body.** Though they seem to be made entirely of emeralds (and some are used in their construction), a smaragdine golem\u2019s body is closer to enchanted glass than to gemstones, a sad truth that has disappointed many plunderers.  \n**A Maker\u2019s Privilege.** Though smaragdine golems are sometimes given to powerful mages, scholars, theurgists, and hierophants as a token of esteem, they are always subject first to the magic and orders of their creators.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Snake with a Hundred Mage Hands: The small snake slithers forward. As it nears a door, spectral hands appear all around it, opening and pushing the door to allow the snake entry._  \n**Pet Project.** Thieves\u2019 guilds with magically inclined members often imbue particularly crafty snakes with keen intelligence, telepathy, and the ability to summon dozens of mage hands to aid the guild. The small, stealthy creatures are capable of carrying out heists that are logistically impractical for humanoids due to their bulk. Predictably, the clever reptiles often escape their creators and carve out small territories for themselves in the more disreputable parts of cities where their true identities won\u2019t easily be discovered.  \n**Mischievous Thieves.** Snakes with a hundred mage hands are known for their mischievous nature. Many are kleptomaniacs and swindlers, using their talents to deceive humanoids and steal objects they find pleasing.",
    "Snow Giant: Flurries drift from the body of this gigantic humanoid seemingly crafted from snow. Its simple clothes are almost pointless, and it carries a massive icicle as a club._  \n**Subservient to Frost Giants.** Snow giants inhabit the same territory as Open Game License",
    "Snow Terror: A sizeable snowperson with sticks for arms, a carrot nose, and a smile etched across its face slowly turns its head. Closer inspection reveals the smile is disturbingly jagged._  \n**Demonic Snow People.** Snow terrors hail from an icy layer of the Abyss. There, they torment lesser fiends or watch as wind-whipped snow destroys visitors wholly unprepared for it. Such visitors are few and far between, leading snow terrors to travel to the Material Plane for greater chances at entertainment.  \n**Innocuous Disguise.** Snow terrors temper their desire for bloodshed and mayhem with patience. They find heavily trafficked areas and lurk nearby, observing potential prey. When choosing victims, they remain motionless in their guise as ordinary snowpersons, even allowing children to pluck the accoutrements off them.  \n**Sadistic Hunter.** A snow terror picks off lone people first, reveling in communities consequently thrown into chaos. Just before it attacks, it reveals its true form: a leering, shark-toothed snowperson with unholy light glowing in its eye sockets. It chases, catches, and devours its victims, relishing the screams as the acid churning in its guts slowly dissolves its prey. It can take on the appearance of its victims, drawing in concerned family members and neighbors before dissolving the facade to attack.",
    "Somberweave: A gray-skinned human steps from the shadows. Dripping mandibles emerge from its too-wide mouth, and six lithe and long arms unfold from beneath its robes to grasp its prey in vicious claws._  \n**Bridging the Veil.** The somberweave is a spider-like fey creature that relies on the fragile threads separating the  \n**Material Plane from the Shadow Realm.** Spanning the gap between the two planes, it weaves a web anchored in both worlds. It hides in the section of its web anchored in the Shadow Realm and waits for victims on the Material Plane. If plied with treasure or food, the somberweave can be convinced to offer travelers in one realm access to the other, but it is just as likely to capture and eat such travelers.  \n**Tenebrous Skein.** The web of the somberweave is made of pure darkness, the essence of the Shadow Realm. Clever travelers who defeat a somberweave can follow the remnants of its web to find passage into or out of the Shadow Realm. Shadow fey who travel frequently between the Shadow Realm and the Material Plane prize somberweave webs as the primary material for creating items that allow for easier travel between the planes.",
    "Son Of Fenris: _The dread sons of Fenris are hideously strong and dangerous in their mastery of the arcane. Their acidic breath stinks of death, and they move with a menacing grace. Eldritch blood runs in their veins._  \n**Demonic Wolves.** Demonic black eyes, two snakelike tongues, and green-black scales beneath their thick black fur betray their unnatural origins. Although the sons of Fenris are powerful spellcasters, they prefer physical violence, using their spells only if faced with foes they cannot simply tear apart.  \n**Hibernate Until Ravenous.** Sons of Fenris are creatures of hunger, rage, and madness. They can subsist on infrequent gorging, so they slumber beneath the snow for weeks or months, waking when they grow ravenous or when prey approaches close enough to smell. When hunting, they revel in wanton savagery and destruction, killing entire flocks or herds to delight in blood and to cast runes among the entrails.  \n**Desperate Worshipers.** Despite their fierce nature, all the sons of Fenris are wise in divine lore, and desperate souls offer them worship and sacrifice in exchange for aid. The sons of Fenris enjoy this adulation, and provide protection, meat, and wisdom to their followers. In some cases, they gather enormous war bands over winter and going reaving in the spring.",
    "Soul Eater: _Creatures of variable appearance, soul eaters conjoin fleshy elements with ectoplasmic forms._  \n**Called from the Abyss.** Soul eaters are summoned from the Abyss and other extraplanar ports of call where they can freely barter for prey. They always have a mental link with their summoner, and often seek to destroy them.  \n**Devour Essences.** Soul eaters do not devour crude flesh, instead feasting on a victim\u2019s soul and spirit.  \n**Hatred of the Sun God.** They bear a particular antipathy for followers of the sun god, and they will go to great lengths to kill his clergy, even defying the wishes of their summoners on occasion.",
    "Spark: _This mote of electrical energy floats menacingly, erupting in a shower of sparks and tendrils of lightning. When it disappears, it leaves only the whiff of ozone._  \n**Born in Storms.** When a great storm rips across a world in the Material Plane, it sometimes tears loose the fabric of reality, releasing sentient creatures composed entirely of elemental energy. Fueled by its frenetic thought patterns and erratic actions, a spark jolts through its new world to find a physical body, drawn by an urge to know form.  \n**Symbionts and Twins.** Some spellcasters deliberately seek out sparks for symbiosis. Sorcerers or clerics devoted to deities of the elements may reach an agreement with these creatures, allowing them to ride within their bodies for their entire lifetime.  \nOccasionally when a spark forms, an oppositely charged mate is created at the same time. When this happens, the two always stay within 300 feet of one another. Sparks rarely survive longer than a year, even within a symbiotic relationship with a mortal form. When they expire, they simply wink out and return to the elemental planes.  \n**Seek Strong Hosts.** When a formless spark senses a potential body approaching, it dims its light or enters a metallic object. Sparks prefer to inhabit creatures with high Strength over other possible targets. Once in control of a body, the spark uses the new vessel to deliver shocking grasp attacks or to cast lightning bolt or call lightning against distant enemies. If ejected from a creature, a spark immediately tries to inhabit another.  \n**Elemental Nature.** A spark doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Spawn of Alquam: This large creature exudes darkness and contempt. It has feathery wings, backswept horns set behind its wide eyes, a narrow, vicious-looking beak, and talon-like claws. Its body is thin and sinewy, and its skin is a sickly green._  \n**Demonic Servants.** These demons lurk in darkness, serving and protecting Alquam, the Demon Lord of Night. Alquam is known to send them to aid his cults, and he sometimes utilizes them to assassinate individuals who threaten his followers. Because the spawn are created by Alquam, many of his cults worship them as physical representations of the Demon Lord himself. The cults believe that offerings to the spawn are conveyed directly to their master in his planar abode.  \n**Kinship with Shadow.** When the spawn of Alquam venture to the Material Plane, they take care to move only in places that are cloaked in darkness. While direct light does not harm them, they find it uncomfortable and often flee from it.  \n**Lords of Birds.** Birds instinctively follow the mental commands of the spawn of Alquam, and sudden changes in bird behavior that can signal a spawn is nearby. Swarms of birds attack targets the spawn designates, act as the spawn\u2019s messengers, and enact the spawn\u2019s or Alquam\u2019s will in whatever way either demon dictates.",
    "Spawn of Hriggala: The enormous worm bursts from the floor, its maw surrounded by writhing tentacles that grab everything edible nearby. An echo of chanting issues from its mouth, as if a hundred evil priests were trapped within its gullet, calling out maledictions._  \nThe spawn of Hriggala resembles a juvenile purple worm with a mouth surrounded by wriggling tendrils and full of razor-sharp teeth. It serves the demon lord on the Material Plane, powered by a steady diet of flesh and stone.  \n**Called by Ritual.** Servants of the undead god of hunger can call up a spawn of Hriggala through ritual and sacrifices. Controlling the hungering spawn once it arrives is another matter.  \n**Underworld Tunnelers.** The spawn of Hriggala are used to create new tunnels for fiends, darakhul, and other monsters of the underworld.  \n**Hungry Demon Nature.** The spawn of Hriggala requires no air or sleep.",
    "Spawn of Rhopalocerex: This large demon is bright orange and yellow, with black markings on its face and wiry body. Its wings are rounded, and its face is insectoid, with large, glowing, red eyes. Black liquid drips from its sharp mandibles. Its long arms end in sharp claws._  \n_**Everywhere Rhopalocerex Needs to Be.**_ The spawn of Rhopalocerex can be found near Rhopalocerex or in areas where the demon lord has some sort of vested interest. They serve as his direct agents, whether he is trying to establish alliances or going to war against some individual or group.  \n_**Lords of Butterflies and Moths.**_ Like the demon lord himself, the spawn of Rhopalocerex enjoy a special kinship with moths and butterflies. Moths and butterflies regularly accompany the spawn, aiding them whenever possible.  \n**Wardens of the Abyss.** The spawn of Rhopalocerex are the wardens of the deadly wild areas of the Abyss under Rhopalocerex\u2019s control, defending it against all who would come to defile it. They originate at the demon lord\u2019s lair in the great tree and fly beneath its wide boughs, looking for threats or awaiting missions to other planes.",
    "Spectral Guardian: _A luminous green mist swirls into the form of an ancient warrior. Dented armor and a ragged cloak enshroud the warrior\u2019s skeletal body, and its grinning skull leers out from an open helm._  \n**Worn Finery.** Composed of faintly glowing green vapor, the spectral guardian is a skeletal being encased in ancient armor or noble\u2019s finery. The cloth is worn and tattered, spiraling away into mist at the edges, and the creature glides with the faintest whisper of sound like a mournful moan from far away.  \n**Eternal Disgrace.** The spectral guardian is the spirit of an ancient warrior or noble, bound to serve in death as it failed to do in life. A broken oath, an act of cowardice, or a curse laid down by the gods for a terrible betrayal leaves an indelible mark on a soul.  \nAfter the cursed creature\u2019s death, its spirit rises, unquiet, in a place closely related to its disgrace. Compelled by the crushing weight of its deeds, the spectral guardian knows no rest or peace, and viciously snuffs out all life that intrudes upon its haunt.  \n**Undead Nature.** A spectral guardian doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Spellhound: A shimmering coat and a ridged snout distinguish the hound from other monstrous canines._  \n**Vindictive Origins.** The first spellhounds began as nothing more than ordinary scent hounds. When the master of the hounds was tormented by a hag, he struck a deal with a powerful fey lord, requesting that his stock be blessed with the ability to hunt the witch. The hounds were returned to him, empowered and mutated, but capable of making short work of the hag nonetheless. After the houndmaster was ostracized for keeping monstrous pets, he grew resentful and concluded that the fey lord had wronged him. He arrogantly set out with his spellhounds after the fey lord that had created them, but he never returned. Ever since, spellhounds have been kept as prized pets by warring fey or set loose in fey-inhabited forests to prey on lonely spellcasters.  \n**Magical Predators.** Spellhounds have olfactory capabilities that allow them to sense the \u201codor\u201d of spellcasters. This, combined with their spell-repelling coats and their magic-disrupting howls, makes them a menace for anyone with even a minor arcane faculty.",
    "Spider Of Leng: _These bloated purple spiders have small claws on their front legs that serve them as handlike manipulators. Their abdomens are a sickly purple-white._  \n**Hate Humanoids.** The nefarious spiders of Leng are highly intelligent. They are a very ancient race, steeped in evil lore and hideous malice, with an abiding hatred for all humanoid races. They sometimes keep ghostwalk spiders as guardians or soldiers.  \n**Dangerous Blood.** Their blood is poisonous and corrosive to most creatures native to the Material Plane. The folk of Leng prize it in the making of etheric harpoons and enchanted nets.",
    "Spider Thief: _This clockwork spider creature is the size of a dog. Each of its eight sharp, sickle-like feet stabs or sinks slightly into the ground. Razor wire enwraps its body, while gyros whirl visibly in its faceless, clockwork head._  \n**Wire Fighters.** A spider thief never initiates combat unless ordered to, but it always defends itself against attack. Its initial attack is whirling its razor line to entangle a target. Once it snares a foe, the spider thief keeps attacking that target until it stops resisting or it escapes from the spider\u2019s wire. By then, it should be ready to ensnare a new victim.  \n**Completely Loyal.** This clockwork machine follows orders from its master even if they lead to its destruction, and it \ufb01ghts until destroyed or told to stand down. The machine recognizes only its creator as its master.  \n**Guild Tools.** The spider thief got its name because its ability to climb walls and to effortlessly cross gaps between buildings up to 20 feet wide makes it an excellent accomplice for enterprising thieves. Some thieves guilds make extensive use of them, and many freelance rogues use them as partners.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A spider thief doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Spinosaurus: _A spinosaurus is a land and riverine predator capable of carrying a platoon of lizardfolk long distances on raids. Often called a river king or river dragon, they are worshipped by bullywugs and other primitive humanoids._  \n_**Friend to Lizardfolk.**_ The spinosaurus is a special saurian bred for size and loyalty by lizardfolk. Lizardfolk prize them like prime warhorses, and lavish them with food and care.  \n_**Enormous Size and Color.**_ This immense saurian has a long tooth-filled maw, powerful claws, and colorful spines running the length of its spine. An adult dire spinosaurus is 70 feet long and weighs 35,000 pounds or more, and a young spinosaurus is 20 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds or more.  \n_**Swift Predator.**_ A spinosaurus is quick on both land and water.",
    "Spire Walker: _This miniscule creature kicks up a ghostly, sparkling fire when it jostles and jigs. Lightning sparks fly between it and its perch._  \n**Storm Dancers.** When storm clouds gather over cities, harbors, and twisted badlands, electrical energy fills the air. During these times, miniscule fey dance on church steeples, desolate peaks, and ships\u2019 masts.  \nAlso called corposanti by scholars, spire walkers are nature spirits that delight in grandiose displays of thunderbolts. They can be found frolicking in a thunderstorm or keeping company with blue dragons or storm giants\u2014though these larger creatures often chase them off for being a nuisance.  \n**Small and Metallic.** These spire walkers stand no more than a foot tall, with dusky blue-gray skin and shocks of silvery, slate, or pale blue hair. Spire walkers prefer clothing in metallic hues with many buttons, and they always carry a handful of tiny copper darts that they hurl at each other during their incomprehensible games. When excited, they emit a sparking glow from the tips of their noses, eyebrows, ears, and pointy shoes.  \nThey play rough-and-tumble games among themselves and enjoy pranking bystanders with frightening but mostly harmless electric shocks. If a spire walker perishes during the fun, the others pause just long enough to say \u201cawww, we\u2019ll miss you\u201d and go through their comrade\u2019s pockets before continuing with the game.  \n**Love Copper and Amber.** Spire walkers like gold but they love copper. They prefer it over all other metals, and they keep the copper pieces in their pockets brilliantly polished. They also value amber gems. Among a group of spire walkers, the leader is not the cleverest or most ruthless, but the one displaying the most ostentatious amber jewel.",
    "Sporous Crab: Most sporous crabs spend a considerable amount of their lives in sewers and brackish ponds. The filth clings to them throughout their lives, and they are toxic to almost every creature they encounter. The sporous crab is usually found near the Open Game License",
    "Spurred Water Skate: The spurred water skate is a diurnal carnivore. It has weak mandibles, but the adaptations enabling it to move on the water make it a powerful hunter. The distribution of the spurred water skate\u2019s weight, along with leg bristles that create and hold air bubbles at the surface, allow it to stand on top of even moderately choppy water and move without sinking. The insect\u2019s sharp forelimbs are powerful enough to kill weaker prey outright, but it prefers to use its limbs to grasp targets and submerge them until they drown. Because spurred water skates move effortlessly across wet surfaces, they are desirable mounts in the swamps and marshes they inhabit. Open Game License",
    "Spy: Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals use **spies** to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal spies would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.",
    "Ssadar: This bipedal reptilian creature has scales of gold that turn to red in the shadow. It has clawed hands but wields a sword. Its breath smells of brimstone, and a hint of smoke can be seen escaping through its nostrils._  \n**Jungle Dwellers.** The ssadar dwell in the jungle and rarely travel to other climates. They prefer the heat, the moisture, and the cover provided by the jungle foliage, though they are capable of surviving in the desert. They live in small cities, usually at the base of mountains near abundant water sources, and they closely monitor the surrounding regions to make sure that non-ssadar are not attempting to approach. Those who make their way toward\u2014or, more rarely, into\u2014their cities are attacked. If captured, intruders are usually sacrificed to their evil lizard gods.  \n**Pyramid Builders.** The ssadar are builders of terraced pyramids with engravings of dragons and their lizard gods. These are temples where they congregate, worship, and perform ritual sacrifices. Most of their cities are built around these magnificent structures, though abandoned pyramids can also be found in the trackless depths of the jungle. The entrance to these structures is at the top, and each of them contains a multi-level labyrinth of chambers inside.",
    "Star Drake: _Twinkling motes of light move around this draconic creature\u2019s body like stars, their reflections twinkling across its metallic scales._  \n**Returned Travelers.** A drake\u2019s curiosity sometimes drives it to seek experiences beyond its plane, and it finds companions with which it travels the multiverse. Such drakes return quite clearly changed in appearance, demeanor, and ability. Regardless of which type of drake embarked on the journey, the creature always returns as a star drake.  \n**Mortal Protectors.** Star drakes consider themselves protectors of the Material Plane. They view those from other planes as meddlers in the affairs of humanoid races, regarding fiends and celestials as equally threatening. Star drakes might negotiate with, drive off, or destroy such meddlers. Occasionally, they lead extraplanar incursions to make it clear outsiders are unwelcome.  \n**Glimmering Lights.** A star drake differs in appearance from dragons primarily by its mottled metallic scales and the nimbus of tiny stars surrounding its body. A star drake measures 10 feet long and weighs roughly 500 lb.",
    "Star Spawn Of Cthulhu: The star-dwelling, octopoid servants and children of Cthulhu are enormous and strange, with clawed hands, powerful but distended brains, and winglike spines on their backs, with which they propel themselves through the frozen emptiness between stars.  \nThese masters of psychic communication and dimensional manipulation can transport themselves and others across enormous distances.  \n_**Mastery of Life and Destruction.**_ They\u2019ve harnessed mysterious energies of life and destruction as well, to grow new life with remarkable speed (and some degree of wastage and cancerous tumors) and to turn living flesh into miasmic vapor through nothing more than focused attention.  \n_**Rituals to Cthulhu.**_ Their goals are simple: oppose the mi-go and aid dread Cthulhu. The star-spawn destroy creatures that will not yield and serve as slaves and sacrifices, rather than allowing them to serve another master. Above all, they insist that all creatures venerate great Cthulhu and sacrifice life and treasure in his name. Their ultimate aim is to bend the heavens themselves and ensure that the stars are rightly positioned in their orbits to herald Cthulhu\u2019s inevitable return.",
    "Steam Golem: _With wicked axe blades fastened along its arms and bronze runes inlaid on its armored torso, a steam golem is a smooth-running machine of death._  \n**Magic Weapons.** The golem\u2019s weapon attacks are magical.  \n**Boilers and Hydraulics.** A steam golem is built around a central boiler with clockwork gears and hydraulic cylinders powering its legs and arms. Most steam golems have axe blades welded onto each of their arms, and many can extend one arm into a single, long-hafted axe for additional reach. They tower 10 feet tall, and their legs are often built with reversed knee joints for greater leverage when they move. The eyes of a steam golem glow orange or red from its internal fires.  \n**Steam Whistle.** A steam golem has four to six vents for releasing steam. These whistles are mounted over the shoulders and can be heard at distances up to a mile in open terrain.  \n**Fuel Required.** A steam golem\u2019s machinery consumes 30 lb. of coal and 100 gallons of water per day if it engages in more than brief combat. When resting or standing guard, a steam golem needs just one third of those amounts.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Stellar Rorqual: This massive cetacean swims through the Void while crackling lines of energy race between the crystal formations on its body and massive, feather-like flippers._  \n**Born in the Void.** Stellar rorqual are born, live, and die in the depths of the space between the stars. Generally peaceful creatures, they live to impossibly old age, singing their ancient songs to each other across immense distances.  \n**Living Starships.** Those lucky or skilled enough can use a stellar rorqual as a living ship to provide passage between planes. This partnership can be based on friendship or domination, depending on the method of training.  \nCommunication with the rorqual is mostly telepathic, and the crystalline growths on the inside of its jaws display what the rorqual sees. Though a stellar rorqual finds it uncomfortable, it can enter the Material Plane from the Void to load or disembark passengers. When this occurs, the rorqual lands in an available ocean, if possible.  \n**Solar Feeders.** The stellar rorqual does not need to eat and seldom opens its actual mouth. As it travels the Void, it absorbs solar energy from stars, which forms crystalline growths on the rorqual\u2019s body. The growths slowly release the energy into the rorqual, providing it with the only form of sustenance it needs.  \n**Void Traveler.** The stellar rorqual doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure.",
    "Stone Creeper: This plant looks like a cluster of vines with elongated tendrils and leaves. A clear fluid drips from its thorns and spatters on the floor around it._  \n**Feed on Stone.** Stone creepers are semi-intelligent plants that feed on the mortar that holds structures together. They are commonly found in abandoned castles, ruins, and underground locations where the tunnels and chambers were reinforced with stone or brick. The stone creepers secrete acid into the mortar holding the building materials together, breaking it down quickly for easy consumption.  \n**Living Traps.** Stone creepers are typically found deeply enmeshed within stone or bricks and hidden in walls. Most creatures that initially see them assume they are ordinary vines. If there is a threat below them, they hastily withdraw from their position, dislodging the bricks or rocks that fall down upon the intruders.  \n**Semi-Social.** Stone creepers tend to live in groups of three to five. Often, they nearly encompass an entire room and feed upon it, waiting for hapless victims to enter a room. After they have consumed all the mortar and caused a collapse, they move on to new areas where they begin the process again.",
    "Stoneguard: The elemental wardens of earth are a stoic people, slow to change socially, and more likely to fight defensive battles and outlast enemies than wage offensive wars. The stoneguard are the perfect embodiment of this ideal; their druidic training has been augmented by ancient combat techniques, allowing them to hold fast against a tide of enemies. They craft arms and armor from the granite around them, and their magical stonecraft rivals that of the dwarves.",
    "Storm Maiden: At the heart of a violent storm, a young woman lies huddled in despair. Her skin is translucent as if made of water, and her tears float up from her face to join the storm above her._  \nA storm maiden is a spiteful elemental that pulls powerful storms into the world through a portal connected to her shrine. Blinded by anguish, she seeks to erase any trace of those who betrayed her.  \n**Primordial Sacrifice.** Long ago, this woman was offered up to powerful spirits to ward off drought and famine. She served her role faithfully. Her shrine was maintained by a ritual of devotion performed by the descendants of those she loved, but it was eventually abandoned. Now, some transgression against her abandoned shrine has drawn the maiden back to the world.  \n**Abating the Storm.** A region plagued by a storm maiden experiences regular flooding and random tornadoes and lightning strikes. A community may yet atone for their ancestral betrayal by performing a long-forgotten ritual at the maiden\u2019s shrine. If appeased, the storms end, and the maiden\u2019s alignment changes from evil to good. An appeased maiden may go on to protect the region for generations, as long as her shrine is maintained, or she might wander to other regions, seeking communities in need who understand the importance of maintaining her shrine.  \n**Elemental Nature.** A storm maiden doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Stormboar: A massive, green-scaled boar snorts angrily as tiny bolts of blue lightning ripple over its body._  \n**Accidental Arcane Creations.** An evoker who raised hogs to fund their wild experiments, accidentally blew up their tower years ago. The explosion created a horrific storm that raged for days in the region, causing the locals to take shelter. When the storm dissipated, the wizard and their tower were gone, but the hogs had been transformed into scaled beasts that harnessed the power of lightning and thunder.  \n**Storm\u2019s Fury.** Stormboars embody the fury of the storm. Just as stubborn and ferocious as their more mundane cousins, stormboars let no obstacle get in their way while they look for food or protect their offspring. Seasoned hunters know to drop an offering of metal behind as they leave the area to ensure the boar is too distracted to follow them.  \n**Metal Devourers.** Stormboars crave metal. Prospectors track the boars to find areas rich with precious minerals and ore, and treasure hunters use the creatures to sniff out hidden vaults of wealth. Anyone relying on a stormboar must be careful, however. The boars see any creature wearing or carrying metal as the deliverer of an easy meal. The aggressive creatures won\u2019t stop attacking until they\u2019ve consumed every bit of metal an unfortunate traveler is carrying. Starving stormboars have been known to venture into civilized areas for a meal.",
    "Strobing Fungus: This creature is translucent with a white core and is composed of a narrow stalk topped with a bulbous head. It suddenly emits a powerfully bright light, then flashes bright and dark in rapid succession._  \n**Chemical Warrior.** The strobing fungus\u2019 body houses chemicals that, when mixed together, cause it to shine brighter than a torch. It also uses those chemicals for self-defense. When it senses danger, it mixes the chemicals inside a pouch within its body and secretes the mixture, which it can then shoot at the creature threatening it. Once exposed to the open air, the chemicals become highly corrosive and toxic.  \n**Wandering Mushroom.** Unlike many fungi, the strobing fungus is able to move, albeit at a slow pace. It does this by severing the portion of its base anchoring it in place and secreting some of the chemicals within its body to help it glide along to a new location. When it has reached its intended destination, it stops secreting the chemical, its movement stops, and the creature quickly attaches to the ground at the new location.  \n**Popular Guards.** Strobing fungi are often employed as guardians, particularly by creatures that have blindsight. The fungi understand rudimentary Common and can obey commands not to attack their master\u2019s allies. They typically assume anyone who has not been specifically introduced to them is an enemy and behave accordingly.",
    "Stryx: _Stryx are the result of mad experiments deep within the plane of Shadows. They resemble owls and can pass as normal birds as long as they don\u2019t speak or open their mouths. The stryx have a larger mouth hidden behind their beaks, filled with gleaming human teeth. Stryx range in color from pale gray to sooty black, with gleaming eyes._  \n**Strange Alchemy.** The stryx are unnatural beings that came about through terrible manipulation of normal owls and kidnapped humans.  \n**The Shadow\u2019s Eyes.** Stryx thrive in the plane of Shadow and on the Material Plane equally, and they enjoy attaching themselves to powerful beings as spies, servants, and translators. Their purposes are muddied, however, because they constantly relay what they learn to their mad creator.",
    "Stuhac: _This pale-skinned, white-bearded hermit wears a winter cloak and travels the mountain paths, cliff sides, and trade routes alone._  \n**Feigns Weakness.** Living in isolated mountain passes and foraging along little-traveled slopes, the stuhac is a master of stealth and deception. Wrapping heavy furs around itself, it poses as a feeble hermit or traveler needing assistance. Only after its victims have been lured away from warmth and safety does the stuhac drop its disguise and show its true nature: the withered traveler's gnarled hands uncurl to reveal jagged yellow claws, its cataract-ridden eyes are exposed as waxen orbs wobbling loosely in their sockets; throwing open its cloak, it proudly shows off woven layers of yellowed tendon and ligament.  \n**Hideous Garments.** The stuhac\u2019s most prized possessions are its \u201cclutters,\u201d garments woven of layered and tangled ligaments and tendons. These grisly trophies are taken from scores of victims, and stuhacs treasure each bit of their disgusting attire. When two stuhac meet, they compare their garb, swapping anecdotes of their most horrifying kills and deceptions.  \nStuhacs weave new ligaments into their clutters while their still-living victims watch. Lying in crippled agony, they cannot flee as the stuhac tears fresh material from their bodies for its garments. To keep screams from disturbing their work, these monsters sever their victim\u2019s vocal chords.  \n**Devour Victims.** Once its clutters are done, the stuhac feeds on its live victim, devouring everything but the bones. Finding a clean-picked humanoid skeleton along a mountain path is a reliable sign of a stuhac\u2019s presence.  \nBecause female stuhacs have never been reported, some believe that these fiends mate with demons, hags, or lamias. Others believe stuhacs are part of a hideous malediction, a recipe for immortality that requires the subject to devour its own kind.",
    "Stygian Fat-Tailed Scorpion: _The black carapace gleams in the desert sun, and its tail drips translucent venom. Even the largest lion avoids this scorpion._  \n**Highly Venomous.** Known for its small size and aggressive behavior, the Stygian fat-tailed scorpion brings a swift death to those who feel its toxic sting.  \n**Pit Traps.** A Stygian fat-tailed scorpion is no more than a foot long, with a tail about the same length. It weighs no more than 5 pounds for the largest specimens\u2014they make excellent guard animals that require little food or care, and are often kept at the bottom of pits or in rarely used tunnels.  \n**Valuable Venom.** A dose of fat-tailed scorpion venom can be worth 4,000 gp or more to the right buyer.",
    "Subek: _For most of the year the subek are a kindly race, advising others and lending their physical and intellectual prowess to local projects. During the flood season, however, subek become violent and territorial, ruthlessly killing and consuming all trespassers._  \n**Riverbank Homes.** Subek are crocodile-headed humanoids that dwell along the banks of great rivers. They are tailless, possessing muscular physiques, surprisingly dexterous hands, and a frightening maw of sharp teeth. They are 9 feet tall, average 700 lb., and can live up to 300 years.  \nDuring the dry season, subek are friendly, thoughtful scholars, historians, and artisans.  \n**Flood Fever.** Subek are well aware of their destructive and violent nature. When the waters rise, they distance themselves from other cultures, warning locals to keep away until the river recedes. Most migrate up or down river to an area with few inhabitants; some even construct underground prisons or cages and pay brave retainers to keep them locked up and fed during their time of savagery.  \nDuring flood fever, subek do not recognize friends or colleagues. They discard all trappings of civilization and kill nonsubek creatures indiscriminately. Once the fever clears, they remember nothing of their actions, though they are surrounded by undeniable, grisly reminders.  \n**Keep Their Distance.** Despite the danger, subek are tolerated and even prized for their skill as engineers, historians, and teachers. They live on the outskirts of many human towns, maintaining a cautious distance from their neighbors. Subek marriage is pragmatic; they live with a mate long enough to foster a single egg and raise the hatchling for a decade before parting ways.  \nSubek scholars and oracles debate their duality. Some believe it to be an ancient curse, a shared ancestry with northern trolls, or some loathsome and primitive part of their soul exerting control. A rare few\u2014shamans and oracles, mostly\u2014embrace their duality and choose to live year-round in remote regions far from civilization.",
    "Sulsha: Larger than a gorilla, this monstrous ape is covered in bright-red fur. It has twin tufts of black hair rising from its head like horns and possesses a bony spur on the end of its long, meaty tail. The creature\u2019s eyes glow with evil intelligence, and it carries a bag filled with various incendiary devices._  \n**Jungle Tyrants.** Sulshas are tyrannical simian humanoids that dwell in thick jungles, particularly in hilly or mountainous regions. Obsessed with conquering those around them, sulshas are in a constant state of warfare with creatures that share their homeland. They even force their simian cousins, such as Open Game License",
    "Suturefly: _These darting creatures resemble dragonflies, but with three pairs of gossamer wings and a body made from splintered wood. Flashes of bright colors run along their bodies._  \n**Sew Mouths Shut.** Forest folk rarely speak when sutureflies dart through the trees, because these creatures listen for lies and sew any offender\u2019s mouth, nose, and eyes shut. Some say the old woods hide nothing but liars, and that is why the deepest forest is shrouded in silence. Others say that the forest uses sutureflies to smother those who break its covenants or reveal its secrets.  \nAdventurers see a suturefly\u2019s handiwork more often than they glimpse one of the creatures directly: corpses with mouths and noses stitched shut lie in the underbrush, mysterious children whose mouths are ringed with black puncture marks observe intruders from afar, and dryads step from trees, their eyes sewn shut against the evils of civilization.  \n**Seek Out Curses.** Numerous suturefly varieties exist. Some attack based on verbal triggers other than lies. Black\u2011banded sutureflies, for instance, detect curses and religious blasphemies.  \nWhen attacking, sutureflies dart from hiding to gain surprise. Once they sew someone\u2019s mouth closed, they target the same victim\u2019s nose, unless threatened by another opponent. Sutureflies attack until they have sewn all of their opponents\u2019 mouths, eyes and noses closed or until they\u2019re destroyed.",
    "Swamp Adder: _A vicious snake with a squat, diamond-shaped head, a puffed neck, and a peculiar yellow band around its body, the swamp adder is a stout, somewhat lethargic hunter._  \n_**Marsh Hunter.**_ This venomous snake\u2014sometimes known as the \u201cspeckled band\u201d\u2014is native to the marshes of southern realms, where it devours waterfowl and incautious halflings.  \n_**Bred for Venom.**_ The swamp adder is simultaneously feared and prized for its potent paralytic venom. A swamp adder is quite thin, though it may grow up to 12 feet long and the largest weigh as much as 50 pounds. A dose of paralytic swamp adder venom is worth 3,000 gp or more on the black market.",
    "Swamp Lily: This large, delicate, orange flower stands guard over a sumptuous banquet laid out near its roots._  \n**Deceivingly Delectable.** Swamp lilies are carnivorous plants that thrive on the rotting remains of creatures they poison. While they can envenom victims with their tentacle-like roots, they prefer to lure in prey with an illusion of a seemingly benign feast. The lilies exude a scent of fruit with the musk from prey animals to complement the illusion. Their victims then peaceably eat the food, unwittingly ingesting the lily\u2019s roots and deadly toxin.  \n**Wandering Menace.** After killing enough prey to keep it well fed and provide nourishment for its seeds, it travels where it can sense creatures with a strong desire for food. Though the plant does not understand the dynamics of food supply, its ability to understand thoughts pertaining to food allows it to relocate where the inhabitants are desperate and more susceptible to its illusory feast.  \n**Grove Guardians.** Druids and creatures respectful of poisonous plants or resistant to the swamp lilies\u2019 illusions often establish a rapport with the lilies as protectors. Partners to the lilies give additional credence to the illusions produced by the plants and encourage unwanted guests to partake of the nonexistent food.",
    "Swamp Naga: A human head tops this green-and-brown constrictor. Vines protrude from its scalp and writhe in unison to the serpent\u2019s swaying motion. Mosquitos, gnats, and other flying insects form a cloud around it._  \n**Self-Proclaimed Ruler and Protector.** The swamp naga is a manifestation of the swamp it inhabits. Its physical form is reminiscent of snakes, and marsh plants grow from its head. The naga\u2019s strong tie to the swamp provides an impetus to protect its home and to believe it is the swamp\u2019s sovereign. Because of this strong link, a swamp rarely hosts more than one naga, unless it covers vast territory.  \n**Insect and Serpent Friend.** The swamp naga\u2019s link to the swamp extends to many creatures within it. Humanoids and mammalian animals that share the swamp with the naga recognize it as a protector and rarely trouble it, though the naga exerts no control over them. A cloud of poisonous biting and stinging insects accompanies the naga, endangering those who draw close to it.  \n**Necessarily Ruthless.** Scholars who have studied the connection between swamp nagas and their domains postulate the nagas\u2019 malevolence is an outgrowth of swamplands\u2019 inherent evil. However, the nagas only use force when trespassers actively harm the swamp or refuse to leave after the nagas attempt to reason with them. Nagas typically encourage those they enthrall to either leave or repair damages. They prefer not to take slaves, since this encourages more intruders and likely further havoc.",
    "Swampgas Bubble: A semi-permeable bubble surrounds a blue-tinged gas. The bubble jauntily bobs in the air._  \n**Consumers of Exhaled Gases.** Swampgas bubbles feed on concentrated exhalations from living creatures. They surround their victims\u2019 heads and extract these gases, usually in copious quantities as their victims panic and breathe harder. This leads many to believe the bubbles are sadistic. However, encounters with swampgas bubbles are rarely fatal, since the bubbles typically sate themselves by the time their prey falls unconscious, losing interest as the creature\u2019s breathing slows.  \n**Attracted to Fire.** A swampgas bubble is instinctively drawn to fire, even though they are highly flammable. Its susceptibility to fire makes it relatively easy to dispatch, but its explosive ending makes the use of fire risky for its foes. In fact, this form of death, accompanied by a beautiful burst of blue light, is just part of the bubble\u2019s overall lifecycle. Its outer layer hardens and shatters, and the remaining bits fall into the swamp where they grow and encase swamp gasses, developing into new swampgas bubbles.  \n**Ooze Nature.** A swampgas bubble doesn\u2019t require sleep.",

    "Swarm of Esteron: Esteron are small, winged salamanders that live in large groups. They cluster around subterranean bodies of water and aggressively protect such places. Some underground creatures see the esteron as a delicacy, but those who hunt esteron know the beasts are quick to form swarms that can easily overwhelm an unprepared hunter.  \nEsteron are highly sociable, communal creatures, and their communities are not lorded over by a dominant member. Instead, they cooperate with one another peacefully. When two groups of esteron encounter one another, they behave peacefully if the nearby water and food is abundant, sometimes even exchanging members. If resources are scarce, however, the group that inhabits the source of water drives away the outsider group with as little violence as possible.",
    "Tar Ooze: A pool of black pitch bubbles on the ground. Skulls and bones rise to the surface with each burst of putrid air. The tar lets out a burbling hiss, as if releasing the last gasp of a creature trapped within it._  \n**Necrotic Sludge.** When a group of Open Game License",
    "Tembril: Standing on its back legs and holding a decapitated human head in its hands, this nightmarish creature resembles a gigantic squirrel with saber-like teeth, soulless black eyes, and hard, scaly skin. It chitters softly and eerily._  \n**Forest Terrors.** In the dark and foreboding forests of the north, tales are spun of terrible ogres, hags, evil wolves, and great arctic serpents, but humans and ogres alike fear the tembril, a savage monstrosity that feeds specifically on the eyes, tongues, and brains of humanoids. Resembling a squirrel the size of a bear, but with brown scales and immense claws and fangs, the tembril hunts sapient fey, humanoids, and giants exclusively, using its claws to eviscerate its opponent as its teeth punctures their skulls.  \n**Head Collectors.** The victim of a tembril attack is almost always found without its head, for the creature collects the severed cranium to devour the contents either immediately or at a later time. Tembrils store the heads in the long winter months, hiding them within the hollows of great trees or in other suitable locations and covering them in ice so they don\u2019t decompose. The decapitated bodies left behind make a meal for many forest-dwelling scavengers, and crows, Open Game License",
    "Temple Dog: _Looking like a mix between a large dog and a lion, the creature glares at everyone who passes the threshold of the temple it guards._  \nA temple dog is an imposing guardian used by various deities to protect their temples. They are fiercely loyal and territorial. Often depicted in temple statuary, the creature has a largely canine body, soft but short hair, a thick hairy tail, and a mane like a lion\u2019s around a dog\u2019s face with a short snout.  \n**Divine Colors.** Coloration and other features of the temple dog vary to match the deity who created it; sometimes a temple dog\u2019s coloration is quite fanciful. Greenish bronze temple dogs are known, as are those the color of cinnabar or lapis. Even coats resembling fired ceramic of an orange hue have been seen guarding some temples. These unusual casts make it easy for a temple dog to be mistaken for statuary.  \n**Travel with Priests.** As a temple protector, it rarely leaves the grounds of the temple to which it has been attached, but temple dogs do accompany priests or allies of the temple during travel. The temple dog cannot speak but understands most of what\u2019s said around it, and it can follow moderately complex commands (up to two sentences long) without supervision.  \nTemple dogs are notorious for biting their prey, then shaking the victim senseless in their massive jaws.",
    "Thin Giant: This tall, emaciated giant has unnaturally long arms ending in razor-sharp talons. It has a strangely conical head with glowing red eyes and fearsome fangs. Its skin is a dark gray-green, and its body is completely devoid of hair._  \n**Giant Bogeymen.** Lurking in abandoned mansions, dark wells, ancient mine shafts, and similar locations, thin giants are one of the most sinister and frightening of all giant species. The villains of many children\u2019s nightmares, thin giants are feared even by other giants, as their life-draining bite and ability to get into tight spaces make them unsettling at best and horrifying at worst. Thin giants don\u2019t get along with most creatures, but they have been observed leading groups of ghouls, ettercaps, and trolls to capture and devour prey.  \n**Contortion Experts.** Thin giants have remarkable control over their bodies. They can twist their limbs into unnatural positions and even bend completely double. The flexibility and elasticity help the giants shrug off crushing blows. They can stay in contorted positions for extraordinary lengths of time and use this to their advantage to ambush unsuspecting creatures.",
    "Thornheart Guardian: A hulking figure clad in a black armor adorned with thorny ornaments slowly walks forward, seemingly unhindered by the thick vegetation of the surrounding woods._  \nThornheart guardians are unyielding and merciless defenders of the forest domains of hags and other sinister fey. They are the twisted cousins of Open Game License",
    "Thrummren: The massive, dog-faced elk charges into battle, lightning crackling between its hooves and antlers, as its giant rider throws bolts of lightning._  \nThe sight of a storm giant charging to battle atop a baying thrummren is both breathtaking and terrifying.  \n**Heavenly Wanderers.** Herds of thrummrens migrate from mountain range to mountain range across vast regions of the  \n**Upper Planes.** As they travel en masse, storm clouds gather above them, and the pounding of their hooves against the ground is akin to thunder. The lightning storms generated by their proximity are truly amazing to behold.  \n**Giant Bond.** Most thrummrens on the Material Plane serve as the mounts of Open Game License",
    "Thuellai: _This raging cloud of animate mist and ice has icicle shards for eyes and claws. In battle or when hunting, a thuellai howls like a dozen screaming banshees._  \n_**Servants of Boreas.**_ These fast-flying creatures of air and ice were created by the lord of the north wind, Boreas, to be his heralds, assassins, and hunting hounds. They appear as a swirling blizzard, often blending in with snowstorms to surprise their victims.  \n_**Terrifying Blizzards.**_ Thuellai love to engulf creatures in their blizzards, to lash buildings with ice and cold, and to trigger avalanches with their whirlwinds. They thrive on destruction and fear, and they share their master\u2019s unpredictable nature.  \n_**Immune to Steel.**_ Northerners especially fear the thuellai because of their resistance to mundane steel, their terrifying howls, and their ability to cause madness.  \n_**Elemental Nature.**_ A theullali doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

    "Thursir Giant: _Heavily armored and carrying two rune-marked hammers, a thursir giant\u2019s reddish hair and beard are often plaited in the style of an enormous dwarf._  \n**Forge Masters.** Greedy and aggressively competitive, thursir dwell in vast caverns under frozen mountains where they labor to forge chains, armor, and massive engines of war. Thursir giants have a natural affinity for metalworking. Any armor or weapons forged by a thursir giant are of the highest quality and can fetch double the usual price for such an item.  \n**Enormous Appetites.** When not toiling at the forge, these giants entertain themselves with gluttonous feasts and boisterous wrestling competitions, or raid human settlements for food and valuables.  \n**Hearth Rune Priestesses.** Female priestesses have a much higher standing in their society than other female thursir giants, who are treated shabbily. Most female thursir giants are drudges, considered fit only for child-bearing and menial labor. However, male thursir are makers, warrior, and metalworkers, while women make up the bulk of their priesthood and spellcasters. As priests and casters, they are valued advisors and held in high regard\u2014or at least very valuable property.  \nThursir stand nine feet tall and weigh 600 lb.",
    "Tidehunter: Emerging from the surf, this massive crab-like beast has a hard, blue shell covered in barnacles. It holds a net of seaweed between its barbed claws, and a look of intelligence gleams in its elliptical, crimson eyes._  \n**Lurkers in the Shallows.** The tidehunter is an ambush hunter, using its coloration to surprise prey that venture into the shallows. Tidehunters are normally found along coasts with plentiful beaches and underwater vegetation, but some can be found in large lakes and river systems close to the open ocean. Most tidehunters are more than 20 feet across and are powerful enough to overcome a hunter shark or small whale with ease. They have few natural predators, their intelligence and guile making them challenging prey.  \n**Net Weavers.** Tidehunters can weave nets out of kelp, seaweed, and other fibrous plant material with ease, constructing nets in a matter of minutes with the weirdly hooked barbs on their claws. Their nets are strong and can be thrown with great accuracy over a large distance. Indeed, even those on dry land are not immune to the tidehunter\u2019s attacks, and more than one human has been hauled into the surging tide from the apparent safety of the beach.  \n**Fishing Buddies.** While fisherfolk and tidehunters are normally at odds, a tidehunter will sometimes enter into an unspoken agreement with a group of fisherfolk, sharing the spoils of the sea while keeping out of each other\u2019s way.",
    "Timingila: This massive shark-eel surges out of the water, opening titanic jaws large enough to bite a ship in half._  \n**Bribable.** Wise captains traveling through timingila hunting grounds often carry tithes and offerings in hopes of placating the creatures.  \n**Lesser Leviathan.** The timingila is one of the largest creatures in the seas. Some scholarly tomes suggest a connection between the timingila and rarer leviathans but no definitive proof has yet been found.  \n**Master of the Seas.** The timingila is an apex predator of the oceans. It hunts whales primarily but eats anything it can catch. The timingila is fiercely territorial and considers all of the ocean its personal domain.",
    "Titanoboa: _A This titanic green serpent can raise its enormous head high above, as much as 20 feet high. Its body extends in seemingly endless coils._  \n**Territorial and Aggressive.** Territorial and voracious, the rare titanoboa devours all trespassers in its domain. Stronger and faster than the giant anaconda, the true king of the rainforest is also more stubborn, fighting off entire groups of hunters and poachers. When stalking prey, these great serpents strike from ambush, swallowing even many dinosaurs in one bite.  \n**Blinding Scales.** Against groups of foes, titanoboas trust in their ability to dazzle their enemies with the light reflected from their scales, using this distraction to entwine the stunned foes in crushing coils.  \n**Slow to Mate.** Titanoboas mate rarely. They live for hundreds of years and never stop growing, which makes the need for propagation less urgent. When two titanoboas nest, the result is a brood of a half-dozen smaller snakes (giant constrictor snakes). An adult titanoboa is at least 80 feet long and weighs 6,000 lb. or more.",
    "Tophet: _An enormous bronze and iron statue filled with fire towers above the ring of chanting, frenzied worshipers._  \nTophets are used by worshipers of fire gods, who toss sacrifices into their flaming maws to incinerate them. A tophet has a large opening in the front where the flames can be seen; sometimes this is an enormous mouth, and at other times it is a large hole in the tophet\u2019s belly. Horns and expressions of anger or wide\u2011mouthed laughter are common.  \n**Eager for Sacrifices.** Among fire cultists, it\u2019s widely known that when a tophet\u2019s hands are raised above its mouth, it is demanding a sacrifice to roll down its palms and into its fiery maw.  \n**Heed Musical Commands.** Flutes and drums can (sometimes) be used to control the actions of a tophet during sacrifices. They have the fortunate side effect of drowning out the cries and screams of living sacrifices.  \n**Magical Fires.** The fires within a tophet\u2019s bronze body are largely magical and fueled by sacrifices. They don\u2019t require more than a symbolic amount of wood or coal to keep burning, but they do require sacrifices of food, cloth, and (eventually) living creatures to keep them under control. A tophet that is not granted a sacrifice when it demands one might go on a fiery rampage, burning down buildings, granaries, or barns until its hunger is satisfied.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A tophet doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

The tales say they are drawn to mankind\u2019s warm hearths and homes and that the sounds of music and mirth enrage them. The stories note that qiqirn are jealous of dogs and that jealousy leads them to kill canines whenever they can. More than a few tales are told of qiqirn that have foolishly become trapped while trying to get at a settlement\u2019s sled dogs. Most importantly, northern children are told that a qiqirn can be driven off by shouting its name at it.  \n**Afraid of Civilization.** Feared as they are by northern communities, qiqirn fear those people in turn. When threatened by civilized folk, qiqirn are quick to flee. When this occurs, a qiqirn often returns by night to steal the food or livestock it was previously denied. When qiqirn attacks have driven an entire community to hunt it, the monster leaves the region for easier hunting grounds.  \n**Spirit Dog.** A qiqirn\u2019s fear of civilization is built on the basis of self-preservation.

    "Tosculi Drone: The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command and iron rule of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places\u2014quick to turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against small villages.  \nThose few tosculi who do not hear their queen\u2019s Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.  \nTosculi drones are the workers of the tosculi hive; the smallest, weakest, least intelligent, and most abundant of the wasp folk. Their carapaces are mostly iridescent blue with gold abdomens and lower legs. A drone stands between 3 and 4 feet tall, and weighs around 50 lb. They have only vestigial wings, so they can glide but not truly fly.  \n**One-Way Scouts.** Drones function primarily as menial workers but, during time of war, they also act as highly expendable scouts and soldiers. Because the warriors know whatever a drone knows (thanks to the hive-queen), a drone doesn\u2019t need to survive its scouting mission to deliver useful information.",
    "Tosculi Elite Bow Raider: The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command and iron rule of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places\u2014quick to turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against small villages.  \nThose few tosculi who do not hear their queen\u2019s Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.  \nTosculi elite bow raiders are smarter and more capable than drones and common warriors, with midnight black or deep green carapaces that shine with colorful iridescence. Their wings are blood red, streaked with dark crimson veins. Elite bow raiders also tower over common tosculi\u2014they stand over 5 feet tall and weigh 130 lb.  \n**Warband Leaders.** Elite bow raiders lead larger raiding parties of warriors and drones to gather slaves and sacrifices. As rare and prized members of the hive, a bow raider\u2019s life is never thrown away like drones\u2019 or risked unnecessarily. Seldom does a tosculi warband contain more than a handful of these elite soldiers, and they frequently hold positions of command. Elite bow raiders always lead the honor guard for their hive-queen, both within the hive and on those rare occasions when the queen ventures outside.",
    "Tosculi Hive-Queen: The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command and iron rule of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places\u2014quick to turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against small villages.  \nThose few tosculi who do not hear their queen\u2019s Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.  \n_This humanoid wasp\u2019s gossamer wings beat out a soft, droning buzz. Flashing blades sing in each of her four clawed hands, and the air around her crackles with arcane energy._  \n**Center of the Hive.** The hive-queen is the nerve center of a tosculi hive-city, simultaneously one of a hive\u2019s greatest strengths and weaknesses. The hive-queen serves as a unifying force. She binds her swarm with an ironclad sense of purpose through the hive mind, the psychic web that links all tosculi within a hive.  \n**Deadly Inheritance.** A hive-queen typically has several immature daughters as her potential heirs at any given time. When she nears the end of her life, the hive-queen selects the most promising of her heirs and feeds her a special concoction. This speeds the heir\u2019s maturation and makes her ready to become a full-fledged hive-queen. The daughter\u2019s first action upon assuming power and control over the hive-city is to devour her mother and all her sisters.  \n**Hive Chaos.** If a hive-queen dies with no heir to anchor the hive mind, the city plunges into chaos. Tosculi bereft of the hivemind go berserk. A few fortunate ones might escape and become lone renegades, but their existence without the comforting presence of the hive is miserable and short. Unless one of the hive-queen\u2019s daughters is mature enough and ruthless enough to step in and assert control, the hive is doomed.  \n\n## A Tosculi Hive-Queen\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nHive-queens make their lairs in the most protected part of the hive. Huge corridors lead to this point, so all tosculi can reach their queen as quickly as possible. This is also the place where tosculi eggs hatch, making it a critical location for the survival of the hive. A tosculi hive-queen encountered in her lair has a challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP), but nothing else in her stat block changes.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive-queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n* The tosculi hive-queen releases a cloud of pheromones that drives the tosculi to fight harder. All tosculi within 60 feet of the hive-queen (including the hive-queen herself) regain 7 (2d6) hit points.\n* A swarm of tiny tosculi offspring crawls from its nest and attacks a creature within 120 feet of the hive-queen, automatically doing 10 (4d4) piercing damage. Then the swarm dies.\n* The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be encased in rapidly-hardening resin. A creature encased this way is restrained. It can free itself, or another creature within 5 feet can free it, by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the creature is still encased the next time the initiative count reaches 20, the resin hardens, trapping it. The trapped creature can\u2019t move or speak; attack rolls against it have disadvantage because it is encased in resin armor; it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws; and it has resistance to all damage. The trapped creature is released when the resin is destroyed (AC 10, 20 HP, immune to cold, fire, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and piercing damage).\n  \nThe tosculi hive-queen can\u2019t repeat an effect until they have all been used, and she can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.  \n\n## Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a tosculi hive-queen\u2019s lair is warped by the creature\u2019s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:  \n\\# Intelligent creatures within 6 miles suffer frequent headaches. It\u2019s as if they had a constant buzzing inside their heads.  \n\\# Beasts within 6 miles are more irritable and violent than usual and have the Blood Frenzy trait:  \n**Blood Frenzy.** The beast has advantage on melee attack rolls against a creature that doesn\u2019t have all its hit points. If the tosculi hive-queen dies, the buzzing disappears immediately, and the beasts go back to normal within 1d10 days.",
    "Tosculi Warrior: The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command and iron rule of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places\u2014quick to turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against small villages.  \nThose few tosculi who do not hear their queen\u2019s Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.  \nTosculi warriors are overseers of work crews and battle groups of drones, directing activities and relaying commands from higher up in the hive mind. They are entirely subservient to the hivequeen\u2019s orders, but if ordered to act independently or to follow their own best judgment, they\u2019re capable of doing so. Warriors are almost never encountered without drones, and tower over them. They stand 4 to 5 feet tall and weigh up to 70 pounds.  \n**Host Finders.** The warriors\u2019 most important role in the hive, however, is procuring live hosts for tosculi eggs to hatch in. Creatures paralyzed by warriors are brought to the queen\u2019s chamber to have eggs implanted in them. An egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, and the ravenous larva devours its still-living (but mercifully unconscious) host.",
    "Transcendent Lunarchida: A four-armed, four-legged creature in the vague shape of a human\u2014but seemingly made of fine spider silk\u2014moves down a tree, slowly chanting the incantation of a spell in the pale light of the full moon._  \n**Made in Corrupt Forests.** Lunarchidnas are beings of moonlight and spider silk created in forests permeated by residual dark magic. When this magic coalesces on a spider web touched by the light of a full moon, the web animates. The web gains life and flies through the forest, gathering other webs until it collects enough silk to form a faceless, humanoid body, with four legs and four arms.  \n**Hatred of Elves.** Lunarchidnas hate elves and love to make the creatures suffer. They poison water sources, set fire to villages, and bait monsters into stampeding through elf communities. These aberrations especially enjoy stealing away elf children to use as bait to trap the adults that come to the rescue.  \n**Cyclical Power.** The lunarchidna\u2019s power is tied to the moon. When the skies are dark during a new moon, the lunarchidna becomes more shadow than living web. Its mental ability dulls, and it becomes barely more than a savage animal. When a full moon brightens the night, however, the lunarchidna becomes a conduit of lunar light and can channel that power through its body. Using its heightened intellect, it makes plans, writes notes, and plots from the safety of the trees where it makes its home. In the intermittent phases of the moon, the lunarchidna is a more than capable hunter, trapping and devouring prey it encounters while retaining enough knowledge of its plans and magic to further its goals in minor ways.

    "Treacle: _A curious bunny, an abandoned infant, or a delicate songbird can spell slow and agonizing death for the unprepared. Beneath any of these facades may lurk a treacle waiting to feed on a gullible victim, mewling and cooing all the while. Whether by natural selection or arcane tampering, these compact oozes prey on kindness._  \n**Diet of Blood.** Treacles feed on blood but lack the natural weapons or acid of larger slimes. To survive, prey must welcome and embrace them, unaware of the threat. The treacles\u2019 soft bodies absorb psychic impressions and take the shape of unthreatening creatures. In the wild, treacles assume the form of an animal\u2019s offspring to lie close for several hours.  \n**Pet Polymorph.** Among humanoids, treacles transform into pets, infants, or injured animals. In the most horrific cases, these oozes resemble children\u2019s toys. Treacles don\u2019t choose their forms consciously, but instead rely on a primitive form of telepathy to sense which shapes a potential victim finds least threatening or most enticing. They can hold a new shape for several hours, even if the intended victim is no longer present.  \n**Slow Drain.** Once they have assumed a nonthreatening form, treacles mewl, sing, or make pitiful noises to attract attention. Once they\u2019re in contact with a potential victim, treacles drain blood slowly, ideally while their prey sleeps or is paralyzed. If threatened or injured, treacles flee. A sated treacle detaches from its victim host and seeks a cool, dark place to rest and digest. With enough food and safety, a treacle divides into two fully-grown oozes. Rarely, a mutation prevents this division, so that the sterile treacle instead grows in size. The largest can mimic human children and the elderly.  \nTreacles are small, weighing less than six lb. Their natural forms are pale and iridescent, like oil on fresh milk, but they\u2019re seldom seen this way.",

One trollkin pulls its spear from its latest victim while its companion raids the victim\u2019s larder._  \nTrollkin raiders are greedy and efficient, moving together under the command of a trollkin leader to take apart a village, a caravan, or a small fortress. Their goal is generally food and portable wealth. Their training as a unit is not extensive but raiders know, trust, and fight for one another.  \n**Night Attacks.** Trollkin raiders attack in a fast-moving, nocturnal group, often using a group of panicked animals or a fire as a distraction in one place while they attack elsewhere. Their assaults are never daylight attacks over open ground; they much prefer surprise and the confusion of night attacks.  \n**Mounted or River Routes.** While trollkin raiders can lope for miles across taiga or through forests, they far prefer to ride horses or row up a river.

Some also serve the deities directly as bodyguards or lead groups of lesser celestials in battle.

    "Veteran Swordbreaker Skeleton: Tougher than a typical animated skeleton, these undead are raised from skeletal remains that have fossilized._  \n**Bones of Stone.** The swordbreaker skeleton\u2019s bones have fossilized and become stony. Most weapons shatter against these bones, but the fossilization makes the skeletons more susceptible to magic that harms stone or that causes concussive bursts of sound.  \n**Undead Nature.** A swordbreaker skeleton doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Vexxeh: This bestial creature would stand over 15 feet tall if erect but is more comfortable crouched with its knuckles resting on the ground. It wears a pair of trousers and a vest, both obviously made for someone much smaller than it. Its cunning eyes belie a malignant intelligence._  \n**Bound to Service.** Though they are not devils, vexxeh are natives of the Hells. Their susceptibility to magical domination makes them ideal lieutenants for evil spellcasters. Once a vexxeh has agreed to serve a master, it adheres to the letter of the agreement that has been struck and refuses to break the contract even under the threat of destruction.  \n**Lovers of Carnage.** Vexxeh only know joy when they are harming living creatures. They relish battle, enjoying the opportunity to shed blood and break bones. More than combat, however, vexxeh enjoy torturing mortals, especially if there is no purpose to it. The psychic distress and trauma suffered by the victims of their torture makes vexxeh gleeful.  \n**Fiendishly Polite.** Despite their love of violence, vexxeh are unfailingly polite. They mimic the etiquette and social norms of their current master\u2019s culture, going so far as to affect mannerisms of nobility. Even when rending a creature into bloody chunks, a vexxeh acts regretful and apologetic.",
    "Viiret: The mouth of this massive flytrap hangs limply, and the smell of decay emanates strongly from it._  \n**Disease Eater.** Viirets feed on diseased flesh and plant matter. The swamplands they inhabit are rife with maladies, giving them plenty of opportunity to find food. Viirets have an acute sense for diseased matter, regardless of the disease\u2019s source. While they aren\u2019t bothered by eating untainted prey, such prey isn\u2019t as nutritionally satisfying. Their stomachs quickly burn through healthy prey, leaving the viiret hungry shortly afterward.  \n**Unpleasant Odor.** The viiret has developed a form of mimicry where its sickly odor deters healthy creatures from approaching it. The viiret is even repellent to most insects.  \n**Desperate Cure.** Marshland societies aware of the viirets\u2019 ability to remove disease often view the plants as agents of harsh deities that demand a price for divine gifts. These societies send plague victims on dangerous pilgrimages to find the plants. The plants devour these pilgrims and remove diseased flesh. This process is dangerous, as many who enter the plant hopeful of eliminating the disease die as a result of the injuries they suffer. To mitigate this, multiple ill people travel together to viirets, optimistic the plants will expel newly healthy specimens in favor of a sickly one.",
    "Vila: _These beautiful, slim women ride on large deer, their hair the color of spring grass, skin like polished wood, and eyes as gray as a coming storm._  \n**Dryad Cousins.** The vila are kin to the dryads. Like their cousins, they serve as protectors of the deepest forests.  \n**Demand Oaths.** Where dryads beguile to accomplish their goals, the vila coerce and threaten. They demand oaths from interlopers and enforce them fiercely. Vila delight in testing the virtue of travelers and tormenting the uncharitable and cruel with bad weather and misfortune. Particularly obnoxious adventurers might suffer bad luck for months because a troop of vila quietly dances around their camp each night.  \n**Hunt with a Pack.** Vila rarely travel or fight alone; they are often seen in the company of alseid, wolves, wampus cats, or deer. In combat, they sometimes ride on fleet-footed deer, the better to escape if events turn against them.",
    "Vile Barber: _A pale, scrawny fellow clad in a black leather apron and slender ebon gloves grins from the shadows. A maw of needle-sharp teeth and the wicked straight razor at his side are a clear warning that his enemies should hasten their footsteps._  \nVile barbers are sadistic, unseelie fey who move through the shadows to execute their bloody, malevolent wills. Known as barbers for both the use of wicked blades and their proclivity for slashing the necks of their victims, these insidious fey can be found lurking in dark and harrowed places like back-alley streets or abandoned, deep-shaded cemeteries.  \n_**Fey Punishers.**_ Called the siabhra (pronounced she-uvh-ra) among the fey courts, vile barbers are fickle creatures. They are sent to punish those who have offended the fey lords and ladies, and their cruelty and cunning help them write messages in blood and skin. At the very least, they scar those who have spoken ill of the fey; those who have harmed or murdered the fey are more likely to be bled slowly. Some of these deaths are made quite public\u2014though in a few cases, the victim is enchanted to remain invisible while the siabhra does its bloody work.  \n_**Slippery Fighters.**_ A vile barber often uses its ability to step through shadows to steal a victim\u2019s weapon and use it against its former owner with devastating effect. Any creature grappled by a vile barber is at the mercy of the barber\u2019s sinister and unclean weapons\u2014they delight in close combat.  \n_**Assassins and Envoys.**_ Vile barbers frequently consort with hags and prowl the places these wicked crones cannot go as emissaries and assassins. Information on the siabhra is scant; most adventurers who meet them don\u2019t live to share their findings or to see the vile barber lick its bloody blade clean.",
    "Vine Drake: Grasping vines form this draconic creature\u2019s wings. Nettlelike teeth fill its maw, and its tail branches like a thriving plant._  \n**Living Vines.** Vines coil around and branch out from the body of the vine drake, and lengthy thorns protrude from its head and down its spine. The poison dripping from its fangs causes a severe rash on its victims. The drake uses the vines around its body to hide in its swampy home and to squeeze the life out of its prey. Despite the vine drake\u2019s plant-like nature, it is still a carnivorous dragon. It prefers deer and other game animals, but it has no problem eating the odd humanoid when it is truly hungry. In the absence of food, it can subsist, though barely, on sunlight if it spends time sunbathing.  \n**Avaricious Bullies.** Vine drakes share the typical greed possessed by most dragons and often shake down humanoids for treasure in return for safe passage through the drakes\u2019 territory. They prefer emeralds and other green precious items that blend with their coloration, and they often secret such items deep within the tangle of vines on their bodies. They usually initiate their demands by grabbing unsuspecting victims in their vines and then threatening to strangle their captured prey unless given green treasures. However, they balk at strong resistance and withdraw into undergrowth if grievously harmed or if they face opponents they can\u2019t overcome.  \n**Flightless Dragons.** Unlike most dragons, vine drakes can\u2019t fly. In their claustrophobic swampy lairs, flight is not necessary. Instead, they use their grasping vines to quickly climb and move from tree to tree to hunt or evade predators.",
    "Vine Golem: A humanoid-shaped tangle of green vines shambles through a portal and gives a friendly wave._  \n**Druid Servants.** Vine golems are constructs created by druids for use as scouts and guardians. These plant-like constructs maintain a psychic connection with their creators, who can see through their eyes and cast spells through them. The golem-creator connection is maintained across the planes of the multiverse and is severed only if the construct or the druid dies. The vine golem is made from a variety of rare plants and flowers found only in the depths of old-growth forests. The process of creating a vine golem is closely guarded by cabals of druids, who will sometimes gift worthy druids with the knowledge in the form of a manual of vine golems.  \n**Golems without Creators.** When a vine golem\u2019s creator dies, the construct carries out the druid\u2019s final orders and then retreats to the nearest wilderness. Driven by a psyche fractured from the loss of its creator, the vine golem guards the animals and plants of its chosen home with extreme prejudice, attacking all intruders, regardless of any previous affiliation they might have had with its creator.  \n**Construct Nature.** A vine golem doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Vine Lord: _Covered with dark green bark and twining tendrils, this longlimbed humanoid exudes a palpable aura of horror._  \n**Melding of Flesh and Vine.** Vine lords are formed from the union of full-grown Open Game License",
    "Vine Troll Skeleton: _These troll skeletons are completely covered in mold and wrapped in flowering vines, and lurk in the shadows of dead tree and profaned groves._  \n**Black Earth Magic.** Vine troll skeletons guard duskthorn dryad glades and the sacred circles of druids; others serve the vila or even moss lurker colonies as guardians. In each case, they were created by dark earth magic for a purpose, and that energy empowers great strength and endurance\u2014but little in the way of wits.  \n**Constant Regrowth.** Their vines regenerate quickly, even after they die. Their powerful regeneration allows vine troll skeletons to reattach severed limbs. Only fire or acid can destroy them and render the living vines harmless.  \n**Bound to a Tree\u2019s Heart.** Vine troll skeletons are direct offshoots of the main vine wrapped around a duskthorn dryad\u2019s tree, a treant, or a weeping treant. Vine troll skeletons are mindless aside from a desire to defend their parent tree, and enchanted troll hearts inside the tree provide their power. Destroying the heart at the center of the tree kills the skeleton bound to that heart instantly.",
    "Virtuoso Lich: The beautiful singer bows to the adoring crowd before stepping behind the curtain. Away from the eyes of the crowd, the singer changes its half-mask, briefly revealing a ghastly, undead visage._  \nA virtuoso lich is an artist whose love of art sustains it beyond death.  \n**Birthed by Art.** A virtuoso lich is created when an artist powerful in both its artistic and magical expression dies with art left undone. Such artists often die before completing or creating a masterpiece, and the torment of the art left undone couples with the artist\u2019s powerful magical talents, turning the artist into a virtuoso lich. A virtuoso lich is bound to an object of art, such as a favorite musical instrument, painting, dance slippers, quill, or some other object of artistic expression that was significant to the lich in life. This piece of art is the lich\u2019s phylactery.  \n**Beautiful Mien.** A virtuoso lich maintains the beauty of its former life, appearing much as it did in life\u2014save for one physical feature that betrays its undead nature. This undead feature can be a clawed, skeletal hand, which the lich hides in a glove; a stiff, zombie-like leg, which the lich disguises with robes and a cane; a face ravaged by undeath, which the lich covers in a beautiful mask; or any other appropriate feature.  \n**Undead Nature.** The virtuoso lich doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.  \n\n## A Virtuoso Lich\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nA virtuoso lich chooses a lair with an eye and ear for artistic potential, whether that lair is an ancient cavern with natural acoustics, a meadow with plentiful natural light, a hall of mirrors, or some other locale capable of enhancing some form of art, allowing the lich\u2019s magic and artistic expression to swell, reaching every corner.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the virtuoso lich takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the lich can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The virtuoso lich channels artistic expression it can see or hear into a magical assault. The artistic expression must be of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait, but it otherwise can be any form of expression not originating from the lich, such as the song of nearby singers that echoes in the lair, the colorful paint decorating canvases, the twirling forms of dancers, or similar. The virtuoso lich chooses a creature it can see within 30 feet of the artistic expression. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) damage of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n* The virtuoso lich enhances the natural artistry of its lair, distracting and hindering nearby creatures. The lich chooses a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a creature has disadvantage on saving throws against the lich\u2019s spells and its Corrupted Art action until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n* The virtuoso lich rolls a d4 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.",
    "Void Dragon Wyrmling: _A dragon seemingly formed of the night sky has bright white stars for eyes. Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon\u2019s body._  \n**Children of the Stars.** Void dragons drift through the empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world, wanderers between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons themselves barely notice.  \n**Witnesses to the Void.** Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing outside has taken a toll. The void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.  \n**Voracious Scholars.** Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.  \n\n## A Void Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nThe true lair of a void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless void between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the void dragon\u2019s lair rests in the great void of space.  \nWhen a void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to reach its treasure hoard hidden in the void. That connection has repercussions, of course, and the most powerful void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.  \nIf fought in its lair, its Challenge increases by 1, to 15 for an adult (13,000 XP) and 25 for an ancient void dragon (75,000 XP).  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n* The Void briefly overlaps the dragon\u2019s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary void dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.\n* Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can\u2019t create bright light in this area.\n* Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon\u2019s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.",
    "Voidling: _Writhing black tendrils stretch from this indistinct orb of pure shadow. The faintest flicker of something green, like an eye, appears for a moment in the center of the globe and then fades to black again._  \n**Called from Darkness.** Voidlings are creatures of the darkest void, the cold space between the stars, drawn to mortal realms by practitioners of foul and corrupting magic known to break the minds of those who wield it. They frequently are summoned servants to void dragons, and they have been seen as wardens of the temples on the Plateau of Leng.  \n**Light Eaters.** They are said to devour life and knowledge and light itself as sustenance; the places they inhabit are known for their dank chill and their obscurity. Voidlings are summoned by those hungry for power at any cost, and\u2014despite their dark reputation\u2014they serve very well for years or even decades, until one day they turn on their summoners. If they succeed in slaying their summoner, they grow in strength and return to the void. Exactly what voidlings seek when they have not been summoned\u2014and what triggers their betrayals\u2014is a mystery.  \n**Cold Tendrils.** Creatures of utter darkness, they can barely be said to have a shape; they consist largely of lashing tendrils of solid shadow. The tendrils meet at a central point and form a rough sphere in which something like an eye appears intermittently.  \nThough their tentacles stretch 10 feet long, the core of a voiding is no more than 4 feet across, and it weighs nothing, darting through either air or void with impressive speed.",
    "Voidpool: An impossibly black pool of goo undulates forward seeming to pull everything around it into its endless depths._  \n**Aspect of the Void.** Some speculate that voidpools are intrusions of the Void itself into the Material Plane. These blots on the surface of the world mindlessly seek to draw everything into the Void through the portal they carry at their cores.  \n**Willing Travelers.** The most daring, and prepared, of adventurers actually seek out voidpools to facilitate passage to the Void. Not resisting the voidpool\u2019s influence allows these brave or foolhardy individuals to minimize the damage they incur enroute to the outer plane.  \n**Ooze Nature.** The voidpool doesn\u2019t require sleep.",
    "Walled Horror: An unnatural, cloying chill fills the air, and multiple ghostly hands burst from a wall to pummel and grab all within reach._  \n**Unassuming Horror.** The walled horror is an undead that appears to be a normal stretch of wall until it lashes out at passersby.  \n**Tragic Origins.** A walled horror is created when a group of humanoids is bound together and entombed behind a wall in an area with a high concentration of necrotic energy. The humanoids experience profound terror before dying of thirst or suffocation, and their spirits remain trapped within the wall, becoming an undead that seeks to add others to its collection.  \n**Entombed Treasures.** While the spirits of the entombed victims join with the stone and mortar of the wall, their bodies and belongings are left to rot in the cavity behind the wall. When the walled horror is destroyed, it collapses into a pile of rubble, revealing the remains and belongings.  \n**Undead Nature.** A walled horror doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Wampus Cat: _A raven-haired young woman rises to the surface of the water as she swims, singing softly to herself\u2014and her lower body is that of a mountain lion. Her sweet song turns to a yowl of rage when she spots prey._  \nWampus cats are all born from an ancient shaman\u2019s curse. Trollkin, orc, goblin, and human shamans alike all claim to be able to transform those who practice forbidden magic into wampus cats.  \n**Forest Streams.** The wampus cat stalks the shores of woodland waterways, using her magic to disguise her true form and lure unsuspecting victims to the water\u2019s edge. She is particularly fond of attacking bathers or those pulling water from a stream.  \n**Hatred of the Holy.** While she prefers to feast on intelligent male humanoids, she holds a special animosity toward and hunger for holy men of any kind. Unless near starvation or if provoked, however, she will not kill women. Indeed, a wampus cat may strike up a temporary friendship with any woman who is having difficulties with men, though these friendships typically last only as long as their mutual enemies live. Some witches are said to command gain their trust and keep them as companions.  \n**Swamp Team Ups.** Will-o\u2019-wisps and miremals enjoy working in tandem with wampus cats; the wisps alter their light to mimic the flicker of a torch or candle and illuminate the disguised cat, the better to lure in victims, then assist the cat in the ensuing battle. Miremals use a tall story to lure travelers into a swamp when the hour grows late, then abandon them.",
    "Wanyudo: Hurtling down the street is a giant wheel, its spokes tipped with reddish flames that sputter and spark as it bounces along. Affixed to either side of the wheel by long strands of greasy black hair are the faces of devilish-looking humanoids, their eyes ablaze like embers. The two faces chortle and cry as the wheel approaches, fire leaping from their mouths._  \n**Born of Heresy.** Wanyudos are the souls of powerful lords condemned to an afterlife of burning torment after they refuted the teachings of the gods and were killed in battle or committed suicide. Prideful and violent monsters, wanyudos are lesser fiends in the grander schemes of Hell, a fact they vehemently resent.  \n**Divine Hunters.** While wanyudos hate all living creatures, the reserve their greatest hatred for creatures marked by a divine entity\u2014such as clerics and paladins, or creatures wearing holy symbols\u2014whom they blame for their cursed existence. When wandering by a monastery or temple, a wanyudo expends every effort to burn the structure to the ground and murder everyone within. Given this, temples and holy sites in areas known to be plagued by wanyudos often fireproof their buildings\u2014and have a reliable source of water nearby, in case the worst should happen.  \n**To Hell and Back.** Wanyudos never stop moving, endlessly rolling along the roads and pathways between the Hells and the mortal world. Because of this, wanyudos know many secret ways into the planes.",
    "Wardu: This creature is round and hovers without the aid of wings. Its skin is a deep red color, with a leathery toughness and texture. It has three forward-facing, segmented eyes and a protruding, bloodstained proboscis._  \n**Unknown Origins.** The origins of the wardu are unknown, though scholars speculate that they came from the Plateau of Leng. It is said they were introduced to the Material Plane as a result of an ill-fated expedition by a group of wizards to the edges of the multiverse. The wizards were attacked by a horde of wardu who followed them through the planar rift they created to return home. Although the rift was sealed immediately, dozens of the wardu were trapped on the Material Plane and have since reproduced for numerous generations.  \n**Blood Drinkers.** Wardu are blood drinkers, and it is the only way they absorb sustenance. They are able to attack and gain sustenance from any creature that has blood, no matter the type. Their hunger drives them to attack most creatures they encounter, though they are smart enough to discern the difference between a potential food source and a more powerful creature not worth provoking.  \n**Magic Hunters.** Wardus have a thirst for the blood of spellcasters and even put themselves at risk to obtain that tastiest of treats. Drinking arcane-infused blood has imbued the wardu with some magical power. It can channel this power through its central eye, but the segmented nature of its eye causes the magic to become unstable and scatter as it passes through the eye\u2019s facets.",
    "Warmth Thief: A diminutive blue humanoid with sharp black claws and exaggeratedly pointed ears floats in the air, emanating a palpable sensation of cold._  \n**Cursed Fairy.** Warmth thieves were fey in the court of the Queen who had the peculiar ability to rob living creatures of their body heat. They attempted to use this power to overthrow the Queen\u2026 and failed. The Queen, amused, allowed them to live, but with a nasty curse: warmth thieves must steal body heat to live, perishing if they don\u2019t regularly take heat from living creatures. Warmth thieves can\u2019t tolerate temperatures much above freezing, preventing them from subverting the curse by moving to warmer climates. Their desire for warmth is so powerful they sometimes throw themselves at creatures that can magically create fire to enjoy a brief, though painful, respite from their suffering.  \n**Unintended Side Effects.** Unknown to the Queen, her curse transfers in an odd way to mortal beings who die at the warmth thieves\u2019 bone-chilling touch. When warmth thieves\u2019 victims die, their spirits return as Open Game License",
    "Water Leaper: _The water leaper is a frogheaded, legless creature with wide batlike wings and a gaping maw. Its shrieks resemble those of a hawk. Its long, sinuous tail tapers and ends in a venomous barb._  \n**Gliding Wings.** The creature has no legs or arms, but sports a pair of wide, membranous wings. It uses the wings to glide beneath the water, as well as to soar through the air.  \n**Scourge of Waterways.** Water leapers plague fresh lakes and rivers. The creatures prey on animals that come to the water\u2019s edge to drink, as well as on fishermen that ply their trade in the water leaper\u2019s territory. Stories circulate among fishermen of fishing grounds notorious for broken lines and missing bait, and fishermen give these areas a wide berth for fear of water leapers. Desperate or unwary fishermen who ignore the warnings are never seen again; drifting, empty boats are the only sign of their passing.",
    "Waverider: The waveriders know firsthand the dangers of the open ocean, and dedicate their lives to protecting seafarers from storms, pirates, and sea monsters. Though they are not warriors, they are accomplished healers and aquatic empaths, using their powers to seek out and rescue survivors of marine disasters, sometimes returning critically wounded survivors to the tribe of elemental wardens itself. The isolationists among the water wardens condemn this practice, fearing that the refugees threaten their way of life. The waveriders take their peers\u2019 scorn in stride, for they would rather be righteous than popular.\nA waverider turns to violence only as a last resort, and prefer to fight in fishform than with their fishing harpoon, using hit-and-run tactics as a shark or their octopus form\u2019s natural camouflage to harry opponents. When patrolling the open seas, waveriders skim across the water on personal waveboards with folding sails, similar in function to the _skysails_ of the wind wardens.",
    "Weaving Spider: This clockwork creature looks like a mechanical spider with long, spindly legs, including one equipped with a particularly sharp blade that\u2019s disproportionately large for the creature\u2019s body.  \n_**Cloth Makers.**_ These tiny but useful devices are a boon to weavers as they help produce clothing\u2014and they also sometimes serve as spies and defenders, for nothing is so invisible as a simple machine making cloth, day in and day out. As their name implies, these devices resemble large spiders but with ten limbs instead of eight. Two of their legs are equipped with loops or crooks useful in guiding thread on a loom, six are for moving and climbing, one is for stitching and extremely fast needlework, and one has a razor-sharp blade used to trim thread or cloth (or for attacking foes).  \n_**Throw Poison.**_ Weaving spiders rarely initiate combat unless directed to by their owners, but they instinctively defend themselves, their masters, and other weavers. A weaving spider throws its poisoned shuttle at the nearest foe, then climbs along the strand to attack that foe. Weaving spiders fight until destroyed or ordered to stand down. When spying, they flee as soon as they are threatened, to preserve whatever information they have gathered.  \n_**Constructed Nature.**_ A clockwork weaving spider doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Weeping Treant: _This twisted tree\u2019s face is made of cracked, black bark knotted into vaguely humanoid features, and thick tears of sap run down its face._  \nWeeping treants clearly are related to other treants, but they are smaller than the normal variety, little more than 30 feet tall with a trunk 3 feet in diameter, and weighing no more than 4,500 lb. Their gnarled trunks are often twisted, and their wood often groans when they move.  \n**Forest Wardens.** Weeping treants are protectors of dark, shadowy forests, and they are as long-lived as the trees themselves. They act as guardians for an entire forest or for something specific within the forest\u2014they have no pity for those carrying axes or fire.  \n**Skeptical Mein.** Weeping treants are terrifying and relentless when fighting in defense of their charge. They are inherently distrustful, particularly of anything not of the natural or shadow world, and they\u2019re notoriously difficult to fool or deceive.  \n**Enchanted Bitter Tears.** Sages and scholars debate why these creatures weep, but no one has come forward with a compelling reason beyond \u201cit\u2019s what trees do.\u201d The weeping treants themselves refuse to speak on the matter. Their tears are occasionally components in druidic spells or items.",
    "Wereowl: This feathered humanoid has piercing eyes, larger than normal for a humanoid\u2019s head, set around a sharp beak. Wings spread from its arms, and its feet end in wicked talons._  \nA wereowl is a hybrid creature usually in service to a powerful creature with dominion over flying creatures. The affinity between owls and elves means that most wereowls are elves, rather than the humans typical among other lycanthropes. The wereowl possesses the keen eyesight that is common to owls, as well as the birds\u2019 preternatural ability to fly silently. Its appetite tends toward its avian nature, and it feasts on rodents and other small mammals, usually raw and directly after a successful hunt. Its attitudes toward rodents extends to wererats and rodentlike creatures, such as ratfolk, and it often prefers to attack such creatures to the exclusion of other foes.",
    "Wereshark: The twisted form of a humanoid shark hunches over, its grin showing rows of jagged teeth. Fresh blood drips from its mouth as it clutches a trident in powerful hands._  \nIn humanoid form, weresharks tend to be powerfully-muscled and broad, with little body hair. They are solitary hunters who sometimes stalk and eat each other. If a wereshark spreads its curse, it\u2019s likely because the lycanthrope made a mistake and let potential prey get away.  \n**Voracious Appetites.** Weresharks are savage predators who, driven by voracious appetites, devour anything they come across. Aggressive in all forms, weresharks prefer to spend their time beneath the waves, hunting fish, seals, and other prey. They have no qualms about attacking humanoids or boats, particularly fishing vessels, which contain even more food for the lycanthrope to consume.  \n**Obsessed Predators.** Weresharks become obsessed with prey that gets away from them. A wereshark can stalk an individual through the seas and over land for months, leaving a path of destruction behind it, just to get a taste of what it missed.",
    "Werynax: Resembling a giant scaled stoat with savage tusks jutting from the corners of its mouth, this monster bears a set of diaphanous, mothlike wings that radiate all the colors of the spectrum._  \n**Eaters of Magical Energy.** The werynax is a fearsome predator that supplements its diet with magical energy from the natural world, occasionally disrupting plant growth rates, water cycles, and weather patterns. Fortunately, werynax are solitary creatures, though female werynax are fiercely protective of their young and may have a litter of up to a dozen offspring. Most werynax live in forests and grasslands.  \n**Strange Habits.** Why and how werynax feed on the magical energy of the natural world has baffled sages and scholars throughout the centuries, though it is clear that the energy werynax consume grants them their magical abilities. Some sages point to magical experimentation on the part of an insane lich or fey lord, while others lay the blame at the feet of the gods, believing the werynax to be some form of divine punishment for misusing the land. Many druids, however, speculate the werynax is an integral part of the natural order\u2014just as death and decay are part of the life cycle, so too is the werynax part of the land\u2019s natural cycle.",
    "Wharfling: _Hairless, ugly, and usually dripping water, the wharfling is a nocturnal raider and fond of stealing from fishmongers and jewelers alike._  \n**Waterborne Packs.** Wharflings have large, webbed hands and feet and oversized mouths. An adept fish catcher, wharflings establish dens near the shores of oceans, lakes, and rivers, and they often move in family groups of 3 or more.  \n**Thieving Gits.** Those who have been bitten by a wharfling rightly fear their needle-like teeth, but most coastal communities hate the animal more for its propensity for theft. Their lairs are invariably filled with stolen metal trinkets.",
    "Wharfling Swarm: _An undulating mass of flesh and teeth, a wharfling swarm is a horrific sight by moonlight._  \n**Bloodthisty Mobs.** These masses of hairless bodies writhe along the coast in the moonlight, and often are mistaken for shoggoths or other much larger creatures. Squeals mingle with the screams of unfortunate fishermen caught in its path.  \n**Beach Swarms.** Periodically, wharflings congregate in huge numbers and tear along the shoreline for miles before finally returning to their dens. Why they gather this way is unknown, but most locals know to avoid the shore on these nights.",
    "White Ape: _This hulking primate looms over others of its kind. Its filthy white fur is matted and yellowed, and a deranged look haunts its blood-red eyes._  \n**Awakened by Sorcery.** White apes were once docile, gentle giants that roamed forested hills and savannah lands. Two thousand years ago, a kingdom of mages awakened the apes, raising their intelligence to near-human level so the beasts could be employed as soldiers and servants, protecting and replacing the humans who were slowly dying off. When the sorcerers died out, the apes remained.  \n**Arcane Wasting.** The enchantment that imbued the apes with intelligence also bleached their fur white and made them carriers of the arcane wasting, a disease that hastened their creators\u2019 demise. The apes are immune to the wasting\u2019s effects, but they can pass it to other humanoids. Among spellcasters, the wasting spreads like a plague.  \n**Driven Away.** The awakening enchantment also gave the white apes a strong desire to serve humans, but because of the risk from the disease, they are viciously driven away from settled areas. They are acutely aware of the injustice that was done to them, and generations of exile have turned their loyalty to animosity, especially toward arcane spellcasters.",
    "Wicked Skull: This skull chatters eerily, gently rocking as it comes to life. It calls out a warning in a hauntingly musical voice._  \n**Origins Unknown.** The origin of these shape-changing monstrosities is unknown, but they have come to be named \u201cwicked skulls\u201d after the form they favor most. Some scholars suggest that they took inspiration from the undead horrors known as Open Game License",
    "Willowhaunt: The ghostly image of a healthy willow overlays a smaller tree composed of bones. Piles of bones litter the ground at its base._  \n**Death Tree.** When victims of murder or other violent deaths die in view of an otherwise healthy willow tree, their spirits flock to the tree. This destroys the willow and causes it to return as a mockery of a living tree. The willowhaunt projects an image of its former appearance to put creatures at ease, at least long enough to convince them to approach.  \n**Thirst for Blood.** Willowhaunts thrive best in blood-soaked soil. They incite murderousness in those who come near by telepathically whispering conspiracies about a creature\u2019s allies. The willowhaunts encourage their victims to make small sacrifices to the willows, ensuring the willowhaunt\u2019s soil remains bloody.  \n**Attractive to Death Cults.** Swamp-based death cults cherish the discovery of a willowhaunt and sacrifice victims to create a grove of willowhaunts. Perversely, a willowhaunt prefers blood shed by unwilling creatures, and it demands the cultists bring victims it can force into a fight.  \n**Undead Nature.** The willowhaunt doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Windy Wailer: A ghostly, moon-shaped comet flies above the water, a cloud of vapor and spectral lights trailing behind it._  \n**Spirits of Violence.** When sailors meet a violent end at sea within sight of the shore and leave no bodies behind to be buried, they sometimes arise as terrible undead known as windy wailers. Caught eternally in the last moments that took its life, the windy wailer seeks to spread its misery to others, raising the elements to overturn ships and drown sailors.  \n**Found in Storms.** Windy wailers are normally encountered in the midst of a great storm or other turbulent weather where they can hide amid the wind and rain before launching their attacks. They often strike when a group of sailors are at their most vulnerable, such as when the ship is close to rocks, the rigging has been damaged, or someone has been knocked overboard.  \n**Unusual Allies.** Aquatic undead, Open Game License",
    "Winter Wolf: The arctic-dwelling **winter wolf** is as large as a dire wolf but has snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil creatures as guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves'deadly breath weapon to use against their foes. Winter wolves communicate with one another using growls and barks, but they speak Common and Giant well enough to follow simple conversations.",
    "Winterghast: This blue-skinned corpse, covered in frosty patches with a ridge of icicles down its spine, lumbers forward._  \n**Eater of Frozen Corpses.** While most types of ghouls prefer freshly killed meat, winterghasts enjoy flesh afflicted with frostbite or gangrene. Since the opportunity for meals is diminished in less populated tundra, winterghasts are careful to avoid spawning additional winterghasts through the disease they inflict. This outlook also prevents winterghasts from gathering in large numbers, but they sometimes form clans for mutual protection and to keep other winterghasts from hunting in their territories. When times become lean, these clans often tear each other apart through infighting, and the survivors scatter to hunt in solitude.  \n**Scorned by Darakhul.** Even from their underground kingdoms, Open Game License",
    "Wintergrim: This squat creature is covered in furs, making it almost as wide as it is tall. A large nose pokes through the furs, and its gentle eyes shine._  \n**Spirit of Hospitality.** Wintergrims are solitary fey who build their homes in remote locations. When they are alone, they spend much of their time traversing the territory surrounding their homes, watchful for creatures in dire straits or in need of shelter. Wintergrims offer assistance and lodging to travelers they encounter and jump to the rescue for those in immediate peril. They readily share the furs in which they bundle themselves and are often laden with warm soups and beverages they share with visitors suffering from the elements.  \n**Inscrutable Rules.** A wintergrim\u2019s hospitality has limits, as each wintergrim has a unique set of behaviors it holds taboo within the confines of its home. Breaking its rules is so abhorrent to a wintergrim, it dares not even discuss the things it forbids. The rules range from the seemingly innocuous\u2014such as leaving one\u2019s boots on when entering a wintergrim\u2019s home\u2014to common societal norms\u2014such as not attacking or killing another guest. Discovering a wintergrim\u2019s proscribed behavior is difficult, since the wintergrim ignores transgressions outside its home, perhaps giving a cryptic warning that it wouldn\u2019t tolerate the same in its domicile. Mere discussion about its rules may also provoke the fey.  \nWhatever the case, wintergrims demand rulebreakers leave their premises at once, resorting to pummeling those who fail to comply.  \n**Competent Woodsfolk.** As loners with occasional guests, wintergrims are necessarily self-sustaining. They are omnivorous, and they grow gardens, set traps, and hunt for their food. Though they are inured to cold temperatures, they enjoy having a house in which they can reside and share their hospitality. They are adept with the axes they wield to chop down trees for their homes and fires, but they are careful not to overharvest wood. Other than when they hunt, they rarely use their axes as weapons. They prefer to punch their opponents in the hope they can drive their foes away, resorting to their axes only in desperate situations.",
    "Witchlight: _This tiny ball of bright light seems to emanate from a crystalline center._  \n**Wizard Servants.** Also called a \u201cspooklight,\u201d a witchlight is a wizard\u2019s servant created from a tiny piece of quartz. It appears as a floating ball of flickering light similar to a will-o\u2019-wisp. The hue of quartz used during the creature\u2019s creation determines the color of each witchlight\u2019s illumination. After the quartz is prepared, it is animated through an extended magical ritual cast under a full moon and a clear, starry sky. Consequently, they are extremely rare by any measure.  \n**Flashing Light Code.** A witchlight always shares the same alignment as its creator. Although it cannot speak, a witchlight understands Common or another language taught it by its creator. Many spellcasters have taught their witchlights a coded cipher, so it can spell out words by flaring and dimming its light. When necessary, a witchlight can spell words in the air by flying so quickly that its trail of light forms letters. This stunt requires a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check per word.  \n**Free Roaming.** If the witchlight\u2019s master dies within one mile of the witchlight, it explodes in a brilliant but harmless flash of light. If it loses its master under any other circumstance, it becomes masterless; it\u2019s free to do as it pleases, and it can never serve anyone else as a familiar. The statistics below represent these independent witchlights.  \nEvil witchlights can be surprisingly cruel, not unlike will-o\u2019wisps. They seek to lure lost travelers into swamps or traps by using their glow to imitate the light of a safe haven. Conversely, good-aligned witchlights guide travelers to places of safety or along safe paths, and they are prized by pilots and guides. Neutral witchlights exhibit a playful nature\u2014sometimes mingling inside the cavities of weapons, gems, or other curiosities, which means those items may be mistaken for magic items. More than one \u201cwizard\u2019s staff \u201d is just an impressivelooking stick with a witchlight perched on top.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A witchlight doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Woe Siphon: This flabby creature squints with beady eyes, licks its lips, and places a bone-white hand to the gaping hole punched through its chest._  \n**Miserable Visage.** Woe siphons are a sad sight when compared to their beautiful and terrible fey brethren. They appear as misshapen humanoids with translucent, glossy skin. All woe siphons possess a through-and-through hole in the chest where their heart should be. When underfed, this hole appears ragged and torn, like a fresh wound. When well-fed, a fragile layer of skin forms over the gap.  \n**Pain Gorger.** Woe siphons feed on negative emotions. To sustain themselves, many migrate to places where sentient creatures suffer in vast numbers or where historical suffering took place, such as mass graves or ancient battlefields. Particularly deadly or dangerous underground locales are common hunting grounds of the hungry woe siphon. Once inside such a place, a woe siphon inflicts suffering on any who cross its path. A favorite tactic involves invisibly stalking adventuring parties to torment their victims for as long as possible before attacking outright.",
    "Wolf Spirit Swarm: _A pack of ghostly wolves appears in a swirl of greenish fog, seeming to coalesce from the fog itself._  \nWhen a pack of wolves dies of hunger or chill in the deep winter, sometimes the pack leader\u2019s rage at a cruel death\u2014or the summoning call of a necromancer\u2014brings the entire pack back to the mortal world as a slavering pack of greenish, translucent apparitions that glides swiftly over snow and ice, or even rivers and lakes.  \n_**Dozen-Eyed Hunters.**_ At night such a swarm can appear as little more than a mass of swirling mist, but when it prepares to attack, the mist condenses into a dozen or more snarling wolf heads with glowing red eyes that trail off into tendrils of fog. A wolf spirit swarm does not eat, but the urge to hunt and kill is as strong as ever.  \n_**Absorb Their Kill.**_ Most such swarms serve powerful undead, warlocks, noctiny, or orcish shamans as guardians and enforcers, terrifying horses and henchmen alike. The souls of those slain by the pack are said to join it.  \n_**Howl Before Combat.**_ Hirelings, mounts, and familiars often panic at the sound of a spirit pack\u2019s chilling howl. Packs of wolf spirits are canny enough to always howl for a time before rushing a herd or encampment.  \n_**Undead Nature.**_ A swarm of wolf spirits doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Wood Ward: This human-shaped amalgam of wood, leather, and forest debris lumbers forward on uneven legs._  \nIn remote villages plagued by evil spirits, locals erect wood and straw people to ward against the spirits in much the same way farmers use similar figures to ward against crows.  \n**Animated Protectors.** When great danger threatens the village, ancient rituals that are passed from generation to generation can be invoked to awaken the wards to defend the village. Wood wards aren\u2019t awakened lightly, however, as the villagers rarely possess the rituals to return the wards to their slumber.  \n**Implements of Terror.** Unknown to most villages that possess them, wood wards were originally created by evil druids to sow terror in logging villages that were encroaching on the forest. The druids circulated wards around these villages, spreading rumors of their protective capabilities. Most of the druids succumbed to age, heroes, or other forces before getting the chance to enact their schemes, and the villages continued on with wards that did exactly as rumored. Some druid circles still possess the knowledge for awakening the true nature of the wood wards, and stories have surfaced of villages in the darkest depths of the forest going silent, possessing nothing but empty houses and a wall of silent wood wards.  \n**Construct Nature.** A wood ward doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Worg: A **worg** is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring creatures weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across the remote wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to speak Common as well.",
    "Wormhearted Suffragan: _This humanoid wears robes to hide its corpselike pallor and lifeless gray hair. Fine, arm-length worms wriggle through abscesses in its flesh and its empty eye-sockets. It moves stooped over, with a shuffling gait, belying its speed and agility._  \n**Dark Worm Hearts.** Formerly, the suffragans were priests or holy officers of other faiths, but their hearts were corrupted by their fear and loathing. Once pledged to the service of a demon lord, it replaced their hearts with a bulbous, writhing conglomeration of worms, which permits them to carry on with an undead mockery of life.  \n**Prey on the Wounded.** They frequent graveyards, casting detect evil or speak with dead to learn who was truly cruel and duplicitous in life. They also follow armies, visiting battlefields shortly after the fighting is over. In the guise of nurses or chirurgeons, they select their targets from among the dead and dying for as long as they remain undetected. In both cases, they cast animate dead to provide the worm goddess with viable skeletal or zombie servants.  \n**Fear Light and Radiance.** Wormhearted suffragans have a weakness; they are especially susceptible to the flesh-searing power of radiant magic, and for this reason avoid priests of the sun god or gods of light. At night, however, they are a walking contagion, infesting their enemies with parasitic worms that devour victims from within. Their favorite tactic is to cast hold person, attack with a helminth infestation, then animate their slain enemies into unlife.  \n**Undead Nature.** A wormhearted suffragan doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Wraith Bear: The black, spectral form of an enormous bear with burning red eyes lets loose a bone-chilling roar._  \n**Corrupted Spirits.** Bear spirits are believed to be the spirits of ancestral warriors and guardians that take on the form of a bear to aid their descendants. Necromancers and dark shamans know magic that twists the mind of these spirits, causing them to feel anger and malice toward the family they once protected. These wraith bears hunt and murder their descendants, listening to no other commands until they have murdered what remains of their family. When this mission is complete, the wraith bear returns to its corruptor, following orders loyally.  \n**Forest Haunters.** If a wraith bear\u2019s corruptor dies and the creature has no family left to hunt, it retreats to the forest. There the bear wanders, its hatred for all life a festering madness that drives it to violence. The wraith bear\u2019s mere presence begins to kill nearby plant life, and it attacks any living creature it finds.  \n**Restored by Archfey.** A wraith bear can be reinstated as a bear spirit by the touch of a fey lord or lady. Finding a fey lord or lady is difficult enough, but convincing it to take on such a task usually involves paying a heavy price.  \n**Undead Nature.** A wraith bear doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Xanka: _This small metallic globe skitters about on many-jointed legs._  \n**Cleaning Constructs.** Created by gnomish tinkerers, xanka are constructs whose purpose is cleaning up their masters\u2019 messy workshops. Most xanka are built from copper, brass, or bronze, but gold, silver, and platinum varieties have been seen in the houses of nobles and rich merchants.  \nXanka are not built for fighting\u2014 their instinct tells them to skitter for cover when danger threatens\u2014 but they will defend themselves when cornered.  \n**Follow Commands.** These constructs only obey simple commands that relate to the removal of garbage. They communicate with each other, but how they do it is unknown.  \n**Absorb Matter.** When a xanka touches matter with its globular body, it absorbs that matter into itself and breaks it down into energy, so that it can seek out more matter to absorb. Gnomes use them to keep the halls and streets clear of refuse. Xanka can absorb matter equaling half their body size every 6 seconds, but all this absorbing and converting doesn\u2019t alter the xanka\u2019s size.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A xanka doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
    "Xhkarsh: _Watching with many rows of eyes, this mantis creature strikes with slashing claws and recurved barbs dripping with venom._  \n**Dimensional Travelers.** The clandestine xhkarsh are beings from another cosmic cycle. Their devices and armor are incomprehensible to\u2014possibly even incompatible with\u2014 creatures of this reality.  \n**Tamper with Fate.** The xhkarsh utilize their fate-altering powers to distort personal histories and manipulate mortal destinies like puppeteers. By doing this, they realign the universe toward their own, esoteric ends\u2014but what those ends might be, only the xhkarsh know.  \n**Foes of Skein Witches.** Skein witches and valkyries are perpetual enemies of the xhkarsh, whom they accuse of perverting the proper run of destiny for both great heroes and ordinary folk.",
    "Xing Tian: This headless brute has two eyes in its chest and a mouth in its belly._  \n**Descendants of a Fallen God.** All xing tian descend from a god of the same name who challenged the eldest deities and lost. As punishment, his head was removed, but he simply grew eyes and a mouth on his chest and continued to fight.  \n**Fearless Warriors.** The xing tian, known by locals as \u201cheadless giants,\u201d live on the fringes of civilization, occasionally raiding settlements for plunder and loot. They dwell in small, isolated villages where leadership roles go to the individuals who can withstand the most pain. The most powerful xing tian wear their hideous scars with pride.  \n**Symbol of Perseverance.** The xing tian\u2019s fortitude and regenerative properties lead many to consider them a symbol of an indomitable will and the drive to continue no matter the hardships.",
    "Yaojing: This long-nosed, fox-like humanoid gestures silently with a smile on its lips and a twinkle in its eyes._  \nYaojing find peace traveling the wilds and quietly helping homesteaders and other travelers. They appear to be wiry redheaded men in light clothing. Their features are a mix of human and fox with a long nose, weak chin, and clever eyes.  \n**Silent Servitors.** Before they arrive on the Material Plane, yaojing take a vow of silence. Their vow precludes them from using their telepathy or voice to communicate with mortals. If a yaojing under vow is forced to communicate with more than sign or body language, it must retire to its planar home to live in silent contemplation for 108 years before it can once again travel the Material.  \n**Charlatan Haters.** Yaojing hate nothing so much as those who would use a mortal\u2019s faith in the gods against them. When yaojing encounter such shysters in their travels, they work tirelessly to bring the charlatans to justice and remove the blight such creatures represent. Yaojing prefer to turn the charlatans over to local authorities for punishment appropriate to the laws of the land they are traveling, but they take on the role of judge when representatives of the law are absent.  \n**Mountain Mystics.** Some yaojing take up a monastic life. They build shrines on mountaintops where they silently teach their small congregations of adherents the joys of a quiet life of service and contemplation. They also teach their disciples how to avoid being fooled by charlatans and that harmonious societies must be free of such liars.",
    "Yathon: This large, bestial-looking creature is dark gray, with powerful muscles, long arms, sharp claws at the end of five-digit fingers, fine, short fur, and enormous, bat-like wings. Its face is an odd combination of orc and bat. Its brows are heavy, its nose is a snout, and its mouth is full of sharp teeth. Its ears are tall and pointed._  \n**Distantly Related to Orcs.** Yathon seem to have just as much in common with bats as they have with orcs. Their species is a seemingly perfect melding of the two, as they have the power and ferocity of the orc but the communal nature, flying, and sonic perception of a bat. It is unknown if they are the product of some mad wizard\u2019s experiment or if they are simply cousins of orcs.  \n**Communal.** Yathon live in communities of ten to twenty. They are brutal and tribal in nature, and they fight ferociously. Yathon often capture prey in their claws, carry it into the air, and drop it from great heights. Despite their primitive tactics, they have a minor precognition that aids them in battle. This precognition seems to be driven by instinct as much as anything else, but many believe it was a gift from some god.",
    "Yavalnoi: Rising up from the seafloor is a nightmarish creature resembling an obese mermaid with a wide, fluked tail, claws, and a humanoid head with a fish-like mouth and large, saucer-like, yellow eyes. An organ like the anchor of a boat emerges from its brow, shedding a pale blue light that glimmers off its iridescent crimson scales._  \n**Monster Creator.** Yavalnois are wicked aberrations capable of procreating with almost any creature from the sea, be it a Open Game License",
    "Ychen Bannog: _Ychen bannogs are massive, ox-like beasts with thick, wooly coats and great horns like the gods\u2019 battering rams. They stand over 40 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh hundreds of tons. Despite their awe-inspiring size, these towering creatures are peaceful wanderers in the wilderness, where their calls echo for miles._  \n**Strongest Beasts in the World.** Legends are built on their sturdy backs. Capable of pulling 670 tons (or carrying 134 tons on their backs), ychen bannogs are the strongest beasts of burden in the known world. Tamed ychen bannogs can haul entire communities, or even small castles, and a clever dwarf with a ychen bannog at her disposal can carve out enormous riverbeds, haul enormous stones, or reshape entire valleys with ease.  \n**Ychen Warships.** Giants have a particular affinity with the ychen bannogs. In times of war, giants sometimes build complex siege platforms atop these beasts, making effective transport for small armies of giants. Thankfully, ychen bannogs are rare enough that even seeing one in an army is a tale to be told for generations.  \n**Louder Than Thunder.** When riled, a ychen bannog can bellow loudly enough to shatter stones and knock down walls.",
    "Young Boreal Dragon: Covered in a mix of hard, blue-white scales and patches of silvery-blue fur, this dragon radiates a savage belligerence. Its amber eyes gleam with primal fury as it stretches its wings, sending a shower of burning sparks sizzling onto the ground._  \n**Paradoxical Predators.** Boreal dragons inhabit the arctic and alpine places of the world, from snow-capped conifer forests and frigid mountain peaks to flat, icy plains and polar seas. Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.  \n**Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon\u2019s admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter. In particular, the dragons are fond of large arctic predators, such as Open Game License",
    "Young Cave Dragon: Covered in black spikes, the dragon\u2019s eyeless head swings from side to side. Darkness creeps from its strange, eel-like hide, spreading like ink in water.  \nApex predators of the underworld, cave dragons are the stuff of nightmare for creatures with little else to fear. They can speak, but they value silence, speaking rarely except when bargaining for food.  \n_**Born to Darkness.**_ Eyeless, these dragons have long, thin spikes that help them navigate tunnels, or seal passages around them, preventing foes from outflanking them. Their stunted wings are little more than feelers, useful in rushing down tunnels. Their narrow snouts poke into tight passages which their tongues scour free of bats and vermin. Young cave dragons and wyrmlings can fly, poorly, but older specimens lose the gift of flight entirely.  \nCave dragon coloration darkens with age, but it always provides good camouflage against stone: white like limestone, yellow, muddy brown, then black at adult and older categories. Mature adult and old cave dragons sometimes fade to gray again.  \n_**Ravenous Marauders.**_ Cave dragons are always hungry and ready to eat absolutely everything. They devour undead, plant creatures, or anything organic. When feeding, they treat all nearby creatures as both a threat and the next course. What alliances they do make only last so long as their allies make themselves scarce when the dragon feeds. They can be bribed with food as easily as with gold, but other attempts at diplomacy typically end in failure. Cave dragons do form alliances with derro or drow, joining them in battle against the darakhul, but there is always a price to be paid in flesh, bone, and marrow. Wise allies keep a cave dragon well fed.  \n_**A Hard Life.**_ Limited food underground makes truly ancient cave dragons almost unheard of. The eldest die of starvation after stripping their territory bare of prey. A few climb to the surface to feed, but their sensitivity to sunlight, earthbound movement, and lack of sight leave them at a terrible disadvantage.  \n\n## A Cave Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nLabyrinthine systems of tunnels, caverns, and chasms make up the world of cave dragons. They claim miles of cave networks as their own. Depending on the depth of their domain, some consider the surface world their territory as well, though they visit only to eliminate potential rivals.  \nLarge vertical chimneys, just big enough to contain the beasts, make preferred ambush sites for young cave dragons. Their ruff spikes hold them in position until prey passes beneath.  \nDue to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon\u2019s hoard may consist largely of food sources: colonies of bats, enormous beetles, carcasses in various states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn\u2019t immediately devour.  \nCave dragons are especially fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, sorted or arranged like artful ossuaries.  \nCave dragons have no permanent society. They gather occasionally to mate and to protect their eggs at certain spawning grounds. Large vertical chimneys are popular nesting sites. There, the oldest cave dragons also retreat to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action for one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.\n* A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom.\n* The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon. Creatures that are in the affected space or that enter it take 22 (4d10) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The swarm lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary cave dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Poisonous and odorless gases suddenly fill passages and caverns, and just as quickly disperse, within six miles of the dragon\u2019s lair.\n* Flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within six miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.\n* Swarms of vermin within one mile of the lair increase in both size and number as they try to escape the dragon\u2019s endless and undiscriminating hunger.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.",
    "Young Flame Dragon: _The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw._  \nThe flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. \u201cMay you be the fire\u2019s plaything\u201d is a curse often used by the foolish.  \n_**Taunting Others.**_ The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure\u2014direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler\u2019s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.  \n_**Malevolent Purpose.**_ The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon\u2019s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.  \n_**Fond of Souvenirs.**_ Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.  \nNothing is safe from a flame dragon\u2019s endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon\u2019s undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon\u2019s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.  \n\n## Flame Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nFlame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest instincts in their prey.  \nMany of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n* The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can\u2019t stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check.\n* A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary flame dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.\n* Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines.\n* Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon\u2019s lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they\u2019re spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days. Any geysers remain where they are.",
    "Young Imperial Dragon: The long, serpentine dragon is wingless and possesses shimmering, opalescent scales. Its appearance is at once both serene and majestic._  \n**Dragons of the Spirit World.** Imperial dragons are tied to the world of celestials, fiends, and spirits. They freely parley with such creatures for knowledge about the outer planes or the fundamental mysteries of the universe. Some of the most powerful imperial dragons even become the servants of the gods in exchange for wisdom, acting as intermediaries between the divine and mortal realms.  \n**Colorful and Magical.** Imperial dragons are capable of changing their colors and forms. They are typically a rich, golden-yellow, but azure-, jade-, and vermillion-colored dragons are not unheard of, and even white and black imperial dragons have been reported. A magical organ in their skulls gives them the ability to fly without the aid of wings, and they are often hunted for this organ, which is rumored to grant eternal life if consumed.  \n**Masters of Wind and Rain.** Imperial dragons are creatures of wind and water, and the eldest of their kind exhibit mastery of these elements. They love the seas where they make their homes and sometimes act as guardians for sacred sites or temples near or beneath the waves. This often puts them in conflict with militant aquatic races like the Open Game License",
    "Young Mithral Dragon: _Mithral dragons are wise and learned, and are legendary peacemakers and spellcasters. They pursue their own interests when not called to settle disputes._  \n_**Glimmering Champions.**_ Light glints off a mithral dragon\u2019s glossy scales, shining silver-white, and its tiny wings fold flush against its body\u2014but open like a fan to expose shimmering, diaphanous membranes. Its narrow head, with bare slits for its eyes and nostrils, ends in a slender neck. The dragon\u2019s sleek look continues into its body and a mithral dragon\u2019s impossibly thin frame makes it look extremely fragile.  \n_**Rage in Youth.**_ Younger mithral dragons raid and pillage as heavily as any chromatic dragon, driven largely by greed to acquire a worthy hoard\u2014though they are less likely to kill for sport or out of cruelty. In adulthood and old age, however, they are less concerned with material wealth and more inclined to value friendship, knowledge, and a peaceful life spent in pursuit of interesting goals.  \n_**Peacemakers.**_ Adult and older mithral dragons are diplomats and arbitrators by temperament (some dragons cynically call them referees), enjoying bringing some peace to warring factions. Among all dragons, their strict neutrality and ability to ignore many attacks make them particularly well suited to these vital roles.",
    "Young Sea Dragon: _This aquamarine dragon has a shark\u2019s head that tapers off into a sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings._  \n**Divine Dragons.** Sea dragons are the children of the ocean, and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.  \nDespite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.  \n**Shipwreck Art.** Sea dragons love collecting treasure, especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon\u2019s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.  \n**Sunken Memorials.** A sea dragon\u2019s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.  \n\n## Sea Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nSea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.  \nWhatever the place, it\u2019s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.  \nThe sky surrounding a sea dragon\u2019s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall\u2019s space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary sea dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.\n* Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water.\n* Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, conditions of the sea surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.",
    "Young Spinosaurus: _A spinosaurus is a land and riverine predator capable of carrying a platoon of lizardfolk long distances on raids. Often called a river king or river dragon, they are worshipped by bullywugs and other primitive humanoids._  \n_**Friend to Lizardfolk.**_ The spinosaurus is a special saurian bred for size and loyalty by lizardfolk. Lizardfolk prize them like prime warhorses, and lavish them with food and care.  \n_**Enormous Size and Color.**_ This immense saurian has a long tooth-filled maw, powerful claws, and colorful spines running the length of its spine. An adult dire spinosaurus is 70 feet long and weighs 35,000 pounds or more, and a young spinosaurus is 20 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds or more.  \n_**Swift Predator.**_ A spinosaurus is quick on both land and water.",
    "Young Void Dragon: _A dragon seemingly formed of the night sky has bright white stars for eyes. Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon\u2019s body._  \n**Children of the Stars.** Void dragons drift through the empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world, wanderers between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons themselves barely notice.  \n**Witnesses to the Void.** Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing outside has taken a toll. The void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.  \n**Voracious Scholars.** Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.  \n\n## A Void Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nThe true lair of a void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless void between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the void dragon\u2019s lair rests in the great void of space.  \nWhen a void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to reach its treasure hoard hidden in the void. That connection has repercussions, of course, and the most powerful void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.  \nIf fought in its lair, its Challenge increases by 1, to 15 for an adult (13,000 XP) and 25 for an ancient void dragon (75,000 XP).  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n* The Void briefly overlaps the dragon\u2019s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary void dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.\n* Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can\u2019t create bright light in this area.\n* Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon\u2019s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.",
    "Young Wind Dragon: _Howling wind encircles the white- and gray-scaled dragon, filling and pushing its wings without the need for them to beat._  \nWind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property, and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.  \n_**Braggarts and Bullies.**_ Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it\u2019s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.  \n_**Lords of the Far Horizons.**_ Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.  \n_**Perpetual Infighting.**_ These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.  \nWind dragons\u2019 hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons quickly. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a smaller number of notable trophies or unique historic items\u2014often quite portable.  \n\n## Wind Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nWind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can\u2019t pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.\n* Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair\u2019s wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n* A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of their next turn.",
    "Yowler: A small house cat gently purrs and twitches its tail. Suddenly it lets loose a blood-curdling yowl as it arches its back. An illusion gives way to the true creature: a rotting undead cat with glowing green eyes, long teeth, and claws like knives._  \nYowlers are undead house pets and familiars with a score to settle and a hatred of the living.  \n**Mistreated in Life.** Many house pets and familiars have terrible masters who mistreat the animals in life.

    "Yumerai: A slender creature with silvery skin moves delicately, as though unsure if the world around it is real. Star-like motes of white light dance in its black eyes._  \nA race of fey said to be born from the dreams of an ancient primeval being, yumerai walk in two worlds. Humanoid in appearance, they possess skin tones that range from pale silver to dark gray. Intrinsically tied to the dream world, they can use sleeping creatures as both weapons and transportation.  \n**Alien Minds.** Although yumerai spend most of their time in the waking world, they have difficulty remembering the differences between dreams and reality. This leads some to misunderstand basic laws of physics or to believe dreams events were real events.  \n**Dream Walkers.** A yumerai can enter an individual\u2019s dreams and use those dreams as a means of transportation to another\u2019s dreams. This process brief connects the creatures, though the yumerai tries not to make its presence known. When multiple people have the same dream, they may have had a yumerai pass through their sleeping minds.  \n**The Gift of Sleep.** For a yumerai, sleep serves as both a tool and a gift. As creatures unable to sleep or dream, the yumerai consider the ability to dream a gift that all mortals should appreciate. As they travel through mortal dreams, yumerai collect energy from the dreams and use it as a form of currency in fey realms. Fey use dream energy in much the same way mortals use paint, creating seemingly alive portraits or making illusions look, smell, sound, or taste more real.  \n**The Horror of Nightmares.** Yumerai usually look forward to the opportunity to experience new dreams. However, not all dreams are pleasant. Particularly horrifying nightmares may leave permanent mental scars on yumerai who witness them, changing them forever. These yumerai take on a sinister and sometimes sadistic personality, seeking to inflict the pain they felt through the nightmare on those around them.  \n**Dream Walker.** A yumerai doesn\u2019t require sleep.",
    "Zalikum: Waves of heat shimmer around a gigantic vulturelike creature made of sand. The sand crackles with dark energy, and the creature\u2019s eyes burn with malign intelligence._  \nAn enormous vulture forged from sand and malignant power, a zalikum is created by mages who capture souls of the damned and infuse them into the superheated sands of the desert.  \n**Abyssal Ties.** The souls infusing a zalikum are from the Abyss. A zalikum\u2019s creator can gather these souls from the Abyss themselves, but, more often, the creator makes a deal with a demon in exchange for the souls. Unfortunately for the creator, the demon usually hands over souls that aren\u2019t the easiest to control, leading many creators to die at the talons of their zalikums. Such destruction frees the demon from its bonds, releasing it and the zalikum into the world.  \n**Innumerable Lives.** The souls infusing the sand of the zalikum can reform it after it has been destroyed. This process consumes some of the power of the souls, forcing the zalikum to devour more souls to fuel further rebirths.  \n**Construct Nature.** A zalikum doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

One bite from the Zanskaran viper can kill a healthy human in seconds, and its tough hide makes it difficult to dispatch quickly.  \n_**Jungle Bred.**_ A Zanskaran viper grows quickly in its jungle home, and some even venture into the savannah to terrorize antelopes and young giraffes. A full-grown Zanskaran viper is up to 30 feet long and weighs up to 400 pounds.  \n_**Famous but Rare Venom.**_ A dose of its viscous green venom is known to fetch as much as 2,500 gp on the black market, but it is rarely available.",
    "Zaratan: _One of the rocks suddenly lurches, and rises out of the water. A great eye glides open in the side of what seemed to be a boulder, and a massive, beaklike mouth gapes in the surf._  \n**Island Reefs.** The zaratan is an impossibly huge sea turtle so large that entire ecosystems develop and grow on its stony, mountainous shell. Drifting on warm ocean currents or settled on shoals, they are often mistaken for small tropical islands. The creature\u2019s head is at least 100 feet in diameter, with a ridge in the center like a tall hill. Its head resembles a massive boulder, and its 200-foot long flippers are mistaken for reefs.  \n**Ageless Slumber.** Zaratans spend their millennia-long lives in slumber. They drift on the surface of the ocean, their mouths slightly open, and reflexively swallow larger creatures that explore the \u201ccave.\u201d They spend centuries at a time asleep. A zaratan may know secrets long lost to the world, if only it can be awakened and bargained with.  \n**Deep Divers.** Waking a zaratan is a dangerous proposition, as their usual response to any injury severe enough to waken them is to dive to the crushing black depths.

    "Zeitgeist: The mumbling humanoid alternates between bursts of speed and inactivity as it struggles to focus on the reality around it._  \nCaught in a chronological maelstrom, zeitgeists struggle to interact with whatever reality presents itself in that moment. Zeitgeists are humanoids who were warped by some misuse or accident of time magic. They are \u201cghosts\u201d of time, flittering from plane to plane, timeline to timeline, unable to anchor themselves with any sort of stability for long.  \n**Fast and Slow.** Warped by time magic, a zeitgeist finds itself alternating between speeding around its foes and being barely able to keep up with them. This alternating is random and outside of the zeitgeist\u2019s control, often pulling it forward in the middle of a conversation or slowing it when attempting to escape an enemy.  \n**Unstable Body and Mind.** The constant instability of being pulled between planes and timelines leaves zeitgeists unable to focus, at best, and deranged, at worst. If a moment of clarity pierces its madness, a zeitgeist might attempt a quick conversation or simply remain motionless, enjoying the temporary reprieve from its tortured existence.  \n**Still Living.** Though named \u201cghosts,\u201d zeitgeists aren\u2019t dead; rather, something mysterious about their situation sustains them. Similar to a ghost, a zeitgeist might be tied to a particular location, albeit at different points in time.

Constantly hungry and illtempered, with the speed to run down horses, lone zimwi have been known to attack large caravans.  \n**Always Starving.** Most of their attacks are driven by hunger. The stomach of a zimwi is larger than its body, extending extradimensionally and driving the zimwi nearly insane with the constant sensation of emptiness, as though it is starving to death. Because of their endless hunger and low intelligence, zimwi have little awareness of the course of a battle. Losing means only that they have not eaten. As long as they continue to feast, they fight on, feeling victorious until death comes to them or all of their prey.  \n**Stomachs of Holding.** The mage-crafters discovered the secret to turning zimwi stomachs into extradimensional containers similar to bags of holding. Using a zimwi stomach in the creation of such items reduces the cost of materials by half.",
    "Zmey: _Crashing through the forest, this three-headed dragon stands upright, its spiked tail thrashing from side to side as it walks. A vicious mouth lined with glistening teeth graces each head, and its green scales gleam in the fleeting sunlight._  \nHunting beneath the canopy of the forest, lurking below the surfaces of lakes, and guarding caves concealing great treasure and mystery, the zmey has two roles\u2014vicious terror and nature\u2019s protector.  \n**Claws of the Forest.** Single-mindedly destructive, the zmey keeps the heart of the forest free from interlopers. Rumors suggest the heart of an ancient forest itself can control the actions of these beasts, while others believe that they have a pact with certain forest druids. Certainly they are clever enough, often destroying bridges, dams, or logging camps infringing on their territory.  \n**Solitary Hunters.** Zmey avoid their own kind, seeking out isolated hunting grounds. They eat any organic matter, but they favor the fresh meat of large birds and mammals. The smarter the prey, the better, because zmey believe that intellect flavors the meat. They consider alseids, halflings, and gnomes especially succulent.  \n**Three-Headed Rage.** Dappled black and green scales cover this enormous beast and its three towering necks are long and powerful. Each neck is topped with an identical, menacing head, and each head is flanked by spiny, frilled membranes. A forked tongue flickers across long pale teeth, and six pairs of eyes burn red with rage.  \nWhen a zmey stands upright, it measures 25 feet from snout to tail. The beast weighs over 9,000 lb.",
    "Zmey Headling: A zmey\u2019s head doesn\u2019t die when severed from the body. Instead, the head rapidly (within 2d6 rounds) sprouts a stunted body and two vestigial claws with which it can fight and drag itself across the ground. Within days it develops into a complete, miniature zmey, and by the time two lunar cycles elapse, the head regenerates into a full-grown zmey with three heads.  \n**Constant Feeding Frenzy.** Such rapid growth is fueled by a voracious appetite. A zmey headling eats everything it can, including its previous body, to satisfy its intense, maddening hunger and sustain its regeneration. Many stories about the horrific violence of the zmey are reports of voracious headlings, not mature zmey.",
    "Zouyu: This elephant-sized feline has sleek fur, four upward-turned fangs in its mouth, and a long tail ending in multiple strands like a pheasant._  \n**Familial Bonds.** Zouyu live as mated pairs with large territories. The great felines are gentle and social creatures, often overlapping their territories for mutual protection.  \n**Good Luck.** For many, the zouyu are symbols of good luck and fortune. The tail feather of a zouyu, freely given, can be rendered into a liquid, which produces a luck potion. The potion brings minor good fortune, such as finding a fruit tree when hungry or shelter when it rains, to the drinker for a day. If a tail feather is taken without the zouyu\u2019s knowledge, the potion created by the feather bestows bad luck on the drinker for a day. Such bad luck manifests as the drinker tripping over a too-perfectly-placed rock or a lightning strike felling a tree onto the drinker\u2019s path.  \n**Herbivores.** Despite their fangs and sharp claws, zouyu are herbivores. Their preferred meals consist of fruit, bamboo leaves, and insects. The zouyu can survive on a very small amount of food despite their size."
